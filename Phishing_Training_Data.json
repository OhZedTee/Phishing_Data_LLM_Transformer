We know that current Home-\nMailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their\ntestimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue\nour success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials\nreceived from Home-Mailers:\n  \n  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity\n  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along\n  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is\n  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes\n  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us\n  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!\n     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL\n  \n  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble\n  making ends meet at my present employment. But\n  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was\n  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the\n  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well\n  deserved vacation.\n     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA\n  \nWhy do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more\nexpensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square\nfoot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +\ntaxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,\nmultiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants\nand more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!\nYour role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an\nemployee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer\nmedical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many\nother aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business\nexpenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of\npersonal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can \nbe done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you\nreceive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a\nsteady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior\nexperience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who\nwant to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher \nexpenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn \nmoney doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help \npeople cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers\nProgram has been perfected so that it has become one of the most \nsuccessful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the\nworld with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take\npart in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require \nthat you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on\nwhatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop\nwhenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any\ndoor to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your\nown home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave\nyour present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family \nto join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!\n  \n  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION\n  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.\n  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working\n  with you, together in the future.\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n"

carcinogenic products for the agricultural , forestry , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and mass retail lawn and garden markets . us biotec ' s ecologically friendly products can replace many of the toxic pesticides and caustic fertilizers commonly used in the agricultural industry . a second advantage beyond being environmentally friendly is that the company ' s field studies conducted in four test markets since 1991 indicate that us biotec ' s products can stimulate plant growth and increase vegetable crop yield by 10 % to 30 % depending on the crop and environmental conditions . us biotec plans to hire a third party to conduct independent tests to determine the precise impact the company ' s products have on crop yield . by altering the concentration of natural components , such as phosphorlating compounds , enzymes , amino acids , minerals , carbohydrates , vitamins and microbes in each product , us biotec can custom design a compound for use on specific crop production problems . for example , some of us biotec ' s products are designed to stimulate root growth and another may promote leaf growth , while another can enhance fruiting buds and yet a different product can help alleviate seasonal water stress . the different primary functions of these biotech products are achieved by altering the ratio and concentration of the common components . us biotec believes that biochemical technology could revolutionize the way food is grown ! usbo ' s products stimulate healthier plants that produce higher quantities of crops , and the company ' s soil products help correct many microbial and mineral problems present in soils today . plus , us biotec ' s soil biostimulants help to rehabilitate the soil ecosystem by breaking down the residual build - up of toxic insecticides , herbicides , fungicides and synthetic fertilizers , thus promoting the restoration of soil to its natural , pre - polluted state . equally as important is the fact that the company believes these biotech products are economically feasible for the majority of produce growers to purchase considering their current commodity prices . us biotec ' s products are formulated with bio - chemical components and this bio - chemical technology is not related to genetic engineering technology . us biotec ' s biostimulants do not influence a seed ' s gene function , but work instead to stimulate vegetative plant growth , promote fruiting sites and enhance the plant ' s immune system function against natural enemies after germination . although , it is logical that healthier plants will produce all - around healthier seeds . us biotec has already completed its research and development phase , and has formulated approximately thirty products that it believes to be commercially viable . usbo is planning to launch all of its agricultural products in the spring of 2005 , and currently plans to launch all of its existing products within 36 months of january 2005 . / / / / / / / / / strategy \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ us biotec  s mission is to establish itself as a profitable industry leader , pioneering the development , manufacturing , marketing and distribution of bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to the agriculture , forest , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and commercial nursery industries as well as to the mass market retail lawn and garden market . us biotec believes it already has a very distinct advantage over its competition because it currently has approximately 30 practical , environmentally friendly bio - chemical products ready to be introduced in various existing markets . usbo is in the process of launching its agricultural products by july 2005 . the company  s strategic plan is as follows : / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / growth strategy \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ it is the ultimate goal of us biotec  s management team to effectively build up the company to sustained profitability while providing shareholders with competitive returns on equity . us biotec may also choose to utilize an aggressive acquisition strategy to consolidate the highly fragmented and immature bio - chemicals industry . continued funding of research development will provide two exceptional products that are some 24 - 30 months from mass marketing status . / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / diversification strategy \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ as us biotec builds its brand name , product recognition , distribution network and reputation as the industry leader in the environmentally friendly bio - chemical solutions market , the company will simultaneously seek out other eco - friendly products to distribute . as part of its growth strategy through strategic alliances , us biotec intends to distribute complementary products manufactured by other companies to applicable markets . usbo  s policy is to stay current with new products and technologies wherever and whenever reasonable and profitable . still , as the company comes across smaller companies that lack distribution capabilities or capital to market their products , but have redeeming products that are ready for market , usbo may form strategic alliances that draw upon the company  s distribution capability to increase revenues through these third party distribution agreements . / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / marketing and sales strategy \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ us biotec understands that providing revolutionary products is not enough to guarantee the company  s financial success . this is why usbo has designed a detailed marketing and sales strategy that takes into account the unique characteristics of how the agri - chemical industry , the retail lawn and garden industry , the golf course industry , etc . operate . the company  s marketing and sales strategy may potentially include the use of teams of independent manufacturer  s representatives ( reps ) . each division picks only the best reps that possess both expertise in the science of our products and strong , established relationships with the particular customers and markets they will be targeting . sales representatives in the agriculture and commercial markets will be closely supported by us biotec  s highly trained in - house technical sales representatives ( tsr ) . these tsrs will be available to provide situational analysis , product recommendations and ongoing training , plus information to the teams of reps , dealer sales organizations and customers . the marketing of lawn and garden products will be given to an experienced professional rep group or by hiring an experienced professional mass market guru . / / / / / / / / / / headlines \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  us biotec set to release products to help cotton farmers fri , nov 19 -

    "email": "towards culturally situated agents * * * call for papers and participation * * * issues in cross cultural communication \" towards culturally situated agents \" http : / / www . nttmsc . com . my / kido / pricai98cfp . html 24th of november 1998 , singapore introduction culture underlies every aspect of social behavior and influences communication style , personality , character , motivation , knowledge and cognition . there is an extensive body of work on cross-cultural differences in communication styles in the linguistics and cultural anthropology literature . in the intelligent user interface design community , over the years , fueled by the recognition that different types of users are motivated by different needs and goals , attention has been given to the development of adaptive user interfaces . however , this line of research and development has given little consideration to the influence that culture plays in shaping what users want out of the computational experience . in order to create interfaces that accommodate different user styles , therefore , it is important to understand these cultural influences , since , in many cases , a user will react to interfaces on the basis of cultural background . similarly , if we are to view an agent , software or robot as a social member of a \" cyber society , \" then that agent must be able to invoke cultural knowledge in order to communicate flexibly with human users and possibly other agents . if agents are reflective only of their designers ' communicative behaviors and are not able to adapt to the styles of other agents which they meet in heterogeneous , distributed environments and virtual reality worlds , then our agents may be trapped in a tower of babel . the goal of this workshop is to discuss cultural influences as they ( may ) inform interactions among human and software agents . this workshop is intended to attract participants from those communities concerned with
