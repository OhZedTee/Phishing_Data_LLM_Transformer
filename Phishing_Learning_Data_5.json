news - commentary - research - analysis ) shares plunged a second straight day wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader ' s bailout merger plan will unravel . a potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping enron , even though its planned acquirer dynegy ( dyn : nyse - news - commentary - research - analysis ) has injected $ 1 . 5 billion of cash , and banks have opened new credit lines . an enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders , and it would cause big losses for the houston company ' s creditors . just before noon est , enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid - december a $ 690 million obligation that was due next week . it also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion secured credit line that has j . p . morgan chase as its lead banker . investors have been fleeing enron since the company last month disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party hedging transactions . the securities and exchange commission is probing enron deals with related parties . the october disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn ' t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances , and it showed that enron was facing serious liquidity problems . those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy . but enron ' s disclosure monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits . in the wednesday release , enron ceo ken lay said his company was still committed to the merger : \" we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees and lenders . \" dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is \" continuing our confirmatory due diligence \" regarding the merger . neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment . after plunging 23 % tuesday to $ 6 . 99 , enron was down a staggering 34 % at one point wednesday . it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $ 4 . 90 . enron shares have lost more than 80 % of their value since the company issued its third - quarter earnings release last month . dynegy dropped $ 2 . 44 , to $ 39 . 26 , though it remains substantially above premerger levels . at the heart of enron ' s trouble is the sense that the company isn ' t letting on the full extent of its troubles . the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct . 16 , when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party transactions . critics of the company said those deals , in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers , raised serious ethical and disclosure issues . the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron , since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron ' s situation . as a result , shares in both companies rallied after the deal ' s announcement . but monday ' s disclosure that enron faced $ 690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed . according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday , dynegy wasn ' t aware of the $ 690 million obligation . critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations . liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $ 5 billion of cash in recent weeks . by the end of 2002 , enron has to find around $ 9 billion to pay back various obligations . it had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash on hand as of nov . 16 , according to the filing . tellingly , dynegy shares haven ' t plunged along with enron , suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for enron but not for dynegy . at current levels , enron shares are trading at more than a 50 % discount to the dynegy offer . j . p . morgan has taken a leading role in helping enron . it has lent funds and it helped restructure the $ 690 million obligation . the bank ' s stock was down 78 cents to $ 38 . 62 . \" we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy , \" said james lee , a top banker at morgan , in the enron release . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : dynegy , enron say merger to proceed by myra p . saefong 1 : 52 pm et nov 21 , 2001 washington ( cbs . mw ) - - merger partners enron and dynegy restated their commitment wednesday to completing a deal , on the heels of embattled enron ' s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay off a $ 690 million note set to come due next week . \" we are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger , \" said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , in a statement . shares of enron ( ene ) recovered slightly in afternoon trading but remained under pressure . on heavy volume , the stock - - which had touched $ 4 earlier in the session - - was down $ 1 . 83 to trade at $ 5 . 16 , a new 10 - year low . some 84 million shares had changed hands . enron declined 23 percent tuesday after the company revealed the upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings . meanwhile , dynegy shares lost $ 1 . 83 to stand at $ 39 . 87 . enron said that the lead bank on the $ 690 million debt agreed to extend the maturity date to mid - december , which will give the company time to restructure the facility , and added it expects to further restructure its debt . \" we . . . believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet , and address upcoming maturities , \" said jeff mcmahon , chief financial officer , in a statement . j . p . morgan chase co . said it and other lenders are committed to helping enron improve its financial position . also , enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with dynegy and said it closed on a previously announced $ 450 million line of credit from j . p . morgan , collateralized by the company ' s northern natural gas co . enron - - which is being acquired by its smaller rival dynegy ( dyn ) at a fire - sale price - - revealed in a securities and exchange commission filing monday that it had to pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt obligations by next monday or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in additional payments . if enron had missed that deadline and didn ' t post collateral , investors had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of enron ' s limited partnerships , the unusual business entities at the center of the company ' s murky transactions currently under investigation . the sec filing of monday also contained yet another restatement of financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more than four years of restated earnings figures . earlier wednesday , goldman sachs lowered its rating on enron ' s stock to \" market performer \" from its \" u . s . recommended list , \" citing \" major \" liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the business it has lost . cibc world markets also cut enron to a \" hold \" from a \" buy . \" commerzbank weighed in wednesday , saying enron ' s viability is in doubt . \" we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , \" analysts andre meade and andrew smith wrote . \" it appears that enron ' s situation could worsen in a number of ways . \" though enron ' s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal situation , meade and smith characterized the information as \" piecemeal . \" \" it appears that the full extent of enron ' s problems is not currently known , \" they said in a note , cautioning clients against investing in enron .",

fortunately the ' 501 deal ' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi 's blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n't understand the \" major used - 501 deal \" in this context : \" what 's the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? \" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 's in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more ' hip ' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 's and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there 's a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 's out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 's , as rumour has it that used 501 's are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 's , what 's it all about \" 501 's are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 's are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi 's . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 's are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you ' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like \" cash for used 501 's . \" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi 's were the prestige brand ; i do n't know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . \" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal \" used 501 's are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans ' \" . witnessing a 501 deal \" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 's , with 'd eal ' meaning ' ( business ) transaction ' , or 'd eal ' could mean ' bargain ' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb ' witness ' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . \" . cowboys like their 501 's blue and stiff \" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n't wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) \" . a used - 501 deal \" i ' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for \" used 501s . \" \" 501 \" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i ' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i ' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i 'd say that a \" major used - 501 deal \" is either a transaction such as the one i ' m proposing for tomorrow or , because \" deal \" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like \" thing \" , a place of business where such transactions take place . \" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction \" \" a major used - 501 deal \" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . \" deal \" is so inarticulate a word that it 's not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to \" getting a good deal \" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n't have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( \" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business \" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone 's having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for \" a major used - 501 deal \" . 1 . \" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans \" 2 . \" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand \" 3 . \" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans \" \" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition ' to witness ' - - at least when it means ' to see sth . ' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the ' 501 deal ' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . \" can best be paraphrased into : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi 's 501 . \" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n't hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland",

    "email": "profit on technology ! ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , \" trillion dollar emerging market \" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of \" bundled services \" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this \" bundled services \" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are \" bundled services \" such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , \" bundled services \" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a \" free package of services \" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that \" word of mouth \" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates \u0026 friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is \" income replacement \" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it \" internetworking \" . the reason we call it \" internetworking \" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing",

So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did\nchange the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces. Any ideas what could have happened ?

Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;\n         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's\n         peculiarly homely interface right now).

' ' enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december . the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy . it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure . enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications . third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d . \" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , \" said tutcher . \" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

noun plus causative-like suffix expressing the ' give ' concept in nahuatl ; ' give ' and other ditransitive constructions in zulu ; the complex verbal morphologies associated with ' give ' verbs in chipewyan , cora , and sochiapan chinantec ;

postposed position is reserved for information that is ' new ' in one of a small number of distinct senses ; and argument-reversing constructions require that the information represented by the preverbal constituent be at least as familiar within the discourse as that represented by the postverbal constituent . within each of the three classes of constructions , individual constructions vary with respect to whether they are sensitive to familiarity within the discourse or ( assumed ) familiarity within the hearer 's knowledge store . thus , although the individual constructions in question are subject to distinct constraints , this work provides empirical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between sentence position and information status . the final chapter presents crosslinguistic data showing that these correlations are not limited to english . the structure of the lexicon in functional grammar hella olbertz , kees hengeveld \u0026 jesus sanchez garcia ( eds . ) ( university of amsterdam ) 1998 . xii , 312 pp . studies in language companion series , 43 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 929 5 price : usd 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3046 3 price : nlg 138 , - - the papers collected in this volume concern five different aspects of the role of the lexicon in the theory of functional grammar as developed by simon c . dik and his co-workers . the volume starts off with a practical introduction to the functional - lexematic model and model applications to english , german and spanish are presented . the second part of the volume deals with the derivation of action-nouns , pseudo-reflexive verbs and causative constructions , thus offering new perspectives on predicate formation within functional grammar . this is followed by a section that centers around an important problem related to valency : the question of how to account for the collocational properties of predicates . the fourth part of the book discusses ( non-prototypical ) transitive verbs and their relation to the typology of states of affairs . the final section focuses on the relationship between the lexicon and the underlying structure of the clause . check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /",

4 , 1999 at the palazzo ducale in genova , italy introduction the international symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend to encompass short-to - long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

So in addition to\nthe \"sequences to always show\" and \"sequences to never show\", a\npreference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder\nwould be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the\nfolder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.\nThis is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining\nproductive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message\nin a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,\nit gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is\npacked, sorted, etc).I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this\nnext one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the\nbar with New Flist Search ...) only contains \"unseen\" and \"urgent\".\nIt would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder\nhappens to have defined.   A \"New sequence\" entry would also be useful\n(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,\nwhich can be done now using \"Search\" and the pick interface, but is\nclumsy that way)Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name\nin the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the\nlist of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...syntax error in expression \"int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))\"\n    while executing\n\"expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsg\" line 46)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_FindMsg $msg\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsgs\" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_PickMsgs\" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)\"\n    (procedure \"PickInner\" line 13)\n    invoked from within\n\"PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}\"\n    (\"uplevel\" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"uplevel #0 $cmd\"\n    (procedure \"busyCursorInner\" line 8)\n    invoked from within\n\"busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets\"\n    (procedure \"busyCursorHack\" line 32)\n    invoked from within\n\"busyCursorHack $args\"\n    (\"cursor\" arm line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"switch $busy(style) {\n\ticon\t\t{busyIcon $args}\n\tcursorAll\t{busyCursor $args}\n\tcursor\t\t{busyCursorHack $args}\n\tdefault\t\t{eval $args}\n    }\"\n    (procedure \"busy\" line 3)\n    invoked from within\n\"busy PickInner $cmd $msgs\"\n    (procedure \"Pick_It\" line 51)\n    invoked from within\n\"Pick_It\"\n    invoked from within\n\".pick.but.pick invoke\"\n    (\"uplevel\" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]\"\n    (procedure \"tkButtonUp\" line 7)\n    invoked from within\n\"tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick\n\"\n    (command bound to event)It has been ages since I did this last though.

I have seen this error message some 1700 times today (between 2 clustered servers) representing a little over 1% failure rate. In an enterprise level I was hoping for more along the lines of maybe one-tenth that .....  It's a network error - That string is not created by \n  Razor Agents.  Its trying to connect and having trouble.  \n  1700 times seems abnormally high.  How many successful\n  connections were there in the same timespan?\n) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway ....  The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs.  \n  No plans right now to make that an option.\n  You can always edit the source - Core.pm.  :)\n) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark?  It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.  The system is designed so servers can be added and \n  subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor\n  client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting\n  all currently available servers and stores results locally.\n) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?)  We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers \n  for those besides us to use.\n) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better .....\n) \n) Sven Willenberger\n) Systems Administration\n) Delmarva Online, Inc.\n  Thanks!  -chad\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.

    "email": "transportation as a commodity . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com [ mailto : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com ] sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 10 : 43 pm to : 168842 @ mailman . enron . com subject : rahil jafry : transportation as a commodity . transportation as a commodity . by bill hensel jr . 09 / 10 / 2001 joc week copyright ( c ) 2001 . the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . , the houston - based energy giant , is familiar with commodity markets . in addition to energy , the business for which it is best known , enron is the world ' s largest metals trader . the company also understands transportation . it ships products as diverse as coal , steel , forest products and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of over - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services , by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product . the company ' s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock moves , and guarantee the service promised in the contract . enron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies , a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position . enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity ? barry par - ker , a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . , which specializes in freight economics , said it could work but that transportation isn ' t like other markets . \" the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , \" parker said . \" i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . \" enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . \" what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , \" reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . \" what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , \" reck said . \" so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . \" enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . \" we are kind of commodity - agnostic , \" reck explained . \" we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . \" enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that . \" we have done that in every market we have gotten into , \" reck said . \" what we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time . you have to show what the benefits are . \" jocoo 000 .

Filmmakers \n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances \n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept -

7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to \" identical \" entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity \" objects . \" * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked \" objects . \" * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are \" identical \" in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form \" equivalance \" classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template \" objects \" consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template \" relations \" consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc - 7 . * st covers a particular scenario , which is kept secret until one month prior to testing in order to focus on system portability ; however , the generalized structure of a scenario template is predefined , and example scenarios are available for participants to examine . this task is domain dependent . * tasks for the experimental tracks are derived from ne and te . there is a world wide web site that allows automated testing following the rules of muc - 6 . it will be of particular value to new participants . the website is password protected and you need to be licensed to access the acl / dci disk from the ldc to obtain a password from chinchor @ gso . saic . com . muc - 6 articles were taken from the acl / dci disk . an anonymous ftp site will be available for downloading muc - 7 related material . this cfp and the muc - 7 participant agreement are available to the public from the ftp site . each participant ( after signing the ldc user agreement and a muc - 7 participation agreement ) will receive a password to download the muc - 7 data , definitions , and scoring software at the release times noted above . the url of the website is http : / / muc . saic . com . the ftp site is ftp . muc . saic . com . test protocol and evaluation criteria : muc - 7 participants may elect to do one or any combination of tasks and experimental tracks . participants will have access to shared resources such as the training texts and annotations / templates , task documentation , and scoring software . all muc - 7 participants are encouraged to participate in the dry run and take advantage of material available . the formal test will be conducted during the first week in march . it will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to the ftp site for official scoring with the software prepared by saic for muc -

' np movement ' has to be reanalysed as transmission of theta roles . these ideas are then applied to a variety of adjectives which take propositional complements . the final chapter argues that for definitions to be understood , the syntax of the language of thought must be close to that of natural language in specifiable ways . for example , semantic types must be common to the two languages . the book will be of interest to linguists concerned with syntax , semantics and pragmatics ; philosophers of mind and of language ; and lexicographers . e - mail : info @ garland . com",

Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):==================================================Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.Their findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs.\"DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY \u0026 RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE.This is what one had to say:\"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing. Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in. At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me. Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :) The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?\"Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ==================================================Another said:\"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl. I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling. I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket. I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25. I'd take that over the Patriots any day. I got excited, and that's when it started to explode. In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks. It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail. I always say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.\"Greg Moran, Boston, MA.For more success stories and photos, go to http://www.cashbynet.net$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED.BE SURE TO SAVE A COPY OF THIS EMAIL AS A TEXT DOCUMENT FOR REFERENCE!!!!

This is critical to YOUR success.================================================== **** SAVE THE NEW MODIFIED EMAIL, AS THIS WILL BE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT WHICH YOU WILL SEND TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS. BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME IN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS DOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM! These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT http://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! =================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors. However, this program will only work if you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work. This is not a program for everybody. If you are just a passer by, and don't have a personal vision of success, delete this now. Life all comes down to a few opportunities - this is one of them. Have the courage to be free, and have the drive to reach your goals. Before you start working with us, take 10 minutes and write down your personal goals. What do you want in 5 years? 1 year? 6 months? Be realistic - set your goals high enough so you will work hard to reach them.

I hope you come along for the ride, it's a wonderful world ahead.Copyright CashByNet 2000 ================================================= http://www.cashbynet.netThe following message was sent to you as a valued webMillion member.

' s shares have fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest energy trader ' s dealings with partnerships run by its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses . enron ' s stock dropped 10 percent today . enron ' s board cost the company at least $ 35 million by allowing chief financial officer andrew fastow to manage ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , partnerships that bought enron assets , a shareholder alleged wednesday in a lawsuit . the lawsuit came the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . the wall street journal reported $ 35 million of the losses were connected with the two limited partnerships . enron also reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the partnerships , the paper reported yesterday . ` ` it looks sleazy , ' ' said roger hamilton , a manager at john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . ` ` if you are someone who invests in a company ' s management , it ' s almost time to punt with enron . ' ' enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls or written requests seeking comment . fastow didn ' t immediately return a telephone call for comment . fastow and a handful of associates made more than $ 7 million last year in management fees and about $ 4 million in capital increases on an investment of about $ 3 million in one of the partnerships , the journal reported today . buying enron assets fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and partnerships that appear to have ties to houston - based enron , based on filings with the texas secretary of state . the foreign business corporations and limited liability companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron ' s corporate address , according to texas records . fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron assets , including foreign power plants . whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last year . under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other ` ` permitted investments .

( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . \" i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , \" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . \" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , \" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . \" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , \" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . \" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , \" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . \" what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? \" asked one frustrated analyst . \" we don ' t know if it ' s limited to this , \" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones \u0026 company , inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . cut to ` hold ' at a . g . edwards 2001 - 10 - 19 16 : 27 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , oct . 19 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp .

    "email": "Once upon a time, Daniel wrote :\u003e What do you pleople think of the strategy to put prerelease\n\u003e (alpha/beta/rc) information in the release field? The above example\n\u003e should then have 6.1-0alpha5 as %{version}-%{release} and when the final\n\u003e version was released it would have 6.1-1.Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the\nspec file since you have to change the \"Source:\" as well as \"%setup\" to\nreflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the\nway you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the\nfinal version and that only the archive name has a \"pr1\" or \"beta6\" in it\nfor example.Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as\n\"0.61-fr0.x\" since the entire source has only \"0.61\" tags everywhere, no\npreversion tags whatsoever.Still, I don't think \"Epoch:\" is an evil hack although it's true that it\nmay cause problems between distributions when used.

( three million five hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) with a bank in europe . presently , this money is still with the bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if i can not come over . presently , i ' m in a hospital in kenya where i have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer . i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i have only a few weeks to live . it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the world . because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to help me stand and collect the funds from the bank . i want a person that is god fearing that will use this money to fund churches , orphanages and widows propagating the word of god and to ensure that the house of god is maintained . the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth . i took this decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i don ' t want my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . i don ' t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner . hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace . i don ' t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband ' s relatives around me always . i don ' t want them to know about this development . with god all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of attorney who is in europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds . please send all emails to : project 4 dneedy @ yahoo . co . in yours in christ , melissa pointer .",

    "email": "california update # 2 , 2 / 23 / 01 1 . bankruptcy an increasingly attractive option for davis despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms , back at the poker table in sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy . indeed , almost any reading of governor gray davis ' s political situation after the shock la federal court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet . at least one of the three major power generators ( pg \u0026 e ) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now , particularly after yesterday ' s ferc ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy . 2 . davis wants to keep hope alive until analyst meetings next week today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the national governor ' s association and meet with wall street analysts tuesday and wednesday . in fact , davis ' s desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in california . according to talks with all sides , davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers ( pg \u0026 e , socal edison and san diego ) for something like $ 7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells . but the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court - ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary , but politically difficult . according to key sacramento officials , \" confidence continues to wane in davis ' ability to do this . the plain fact is the stick he ' s carrying isn ' t awfully big . \" adds another : \" the key people here just think the utilities are playing him . either they ' re playing him , or he ' s going to roll on the price , he ' s going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth . the utilities got away with the same kind of thing before , in 1996 of course . \" davis is more astute than that , and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in los angeles . 3 . little support for transmission assets deal the transmission assets deal doesn ' t look attractive for anyone . davis has no particular affinity for it , having adopted state senator burton ' s proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade . the legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry , and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network . the utilities - - pg state offers only tepid support for bond scheme \" there are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn ' t pick up \" says one california official . \" the way they calculate depreciation is very strange . if the accounts were done on a proper gaap basis instead of some kind of ferc basis they would look different . \" even if the deal goes through , the financing could be difficult and very expensive . the state has definitively ruled out putting the full faith and credit of the state of california behind the proposed bonds . state treasurer angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they ' d qualify for tax - exempt status . 5 . small ipp players furious and while the big players talk , there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators . the small companies have been the biggest losers so far - - their representative , jan smutny - jones , was tossed off the board of the california iso , and the closing of the california px deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power . the ceos of large companies like dynegy and reliant are talking to davis on a daily basis , but the small companies are out of the loop . they also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long . large companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential political and relationship risks across the us if they get cast in the role of villain in california . for the small companies , however , it is a matter of survival . some legislators in sacramento are operating under the assumption that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to force bankruptcy . not so . all it takes is three creditors owed at least $ 11 , 000 each to apply for bankruptcy . two small companies , cal energy and ridgewood power , are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment . if bankruptcy is triggered , there is immense uncertainty about what would happen . no major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome , especially after the shock of judge lew ' s unexpected ruling in los angeles . it is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the state supreme court . ferc and the federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly . but to many of the players , that uncertain mess following bankruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal .",

Stealing my $1,000 sterio and then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy overall. For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase social value, involuntary ones decrease it. If the sterio was worth as much to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...On the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but the owner's availability to make a contract was problematic.

He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share.

This\nis why we are soliciting your assistance in this \nmanner and regard .As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address\nfrom adverts in the business directory . I am the \nChief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )\nof the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \n( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and\nTROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. \nOfficials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this\nMinistry. We have been exercising patience for this \nopportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity\nwe cannot afford to miss.We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of\nus and I and one of my colleagues \ninvolved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,\nupon the confirmation from you that the Certified \nInternational Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your\ninterest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel \nNo: +873-762-692484.

- - - - original message - - - - - from : lbechterhoff @ aep . com @ enron [ mailto : imceanotes - lbechterhoff + 40 aep + 2 ecom + 40 enron @ enron . com ] sent : thursday , july 19 , 2001 10 : 44 am to : brown , aaron ( executive comp ) ; jones , robert w . - hr exec ; kitchen , louise subject : enron stock options of hpl employees gentlemen : attached below are copies of some correspondence between fran mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from enron due to the sale of houston pipe line to aep . apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such cases - - the norm seems to be three years . however , employees who were able to participate in the original \" all - employee \" stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year . it seems that employees who joined enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree , but were allowed a three - year period in the case of involuntary termination . following are the facts material to this issue : 1 . fran mays was represented to hpl employees as the authoritative source of information regarding enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of hpl . 2 . even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist , the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative enron source . it is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation . 3 . in an instance of a divestiture , merger , or other change of control of a company , in my personal experience , there can be , and often are , modifications and exceptions to benefit plans . usually this is done in the interest of fairness to employees affected . in my own case in the sale of hpl , there was an exception made since i did not retire from enron , but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired . this allowed me to be vested in some stock options that i would have lost . the monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since i only had about 25 unvested share options , but it is a precedent . 4 . i submitted to fran mays , through my supervisor , a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period . 5 . the only response to the specific written question that i submitted was contained in a general q \u0026 a format response from fran mays which contains an unequivocal , direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of hpl is three years . 6 . there was a disclaimer in the q \u0026 a document that referenced plan documents . a disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity , but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct , clear , unequivocal statement of fact . there is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact . i , among a number of hpl employees who are former enron employees , made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the q \u0026 a that we had three years to exercise all options . the one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences . although i recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options , in my case the combined impact could be very significant . from aep ' s perspective , enron employees who agreed to stay with hpl and move to aep with the sale added a great deal of value to the hpl acquisition . it seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited enron . i am requesting that the time to exercise the original all - employee options be extended to three years . this would make this stock option plan consistent with other enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to hpl employees that the period would be three years . this change would allow hpl employees who acted as loyal enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted enron to feel that they were treated fairly by enron . l . b . echterhoff lbechterhoff @ aep . com 832 - 668 - 1204 from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 31 / 2001 01 : 18 pm to : lal echterhoff / hou / ect @ ect cc : brian redmond / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : stock option questions lal , thanks for your comments . i have verified with the corporate compensation group and legal and unfortunately enron is not able to remedy this situation . the plan document provisions supercede the q \u0026 a . fran - - - - - original message - - - - - from : echterhoff , lal sent : thursday , may 31 , 2001 10 : 53 am to : mayes , fran l . cc : brian redmond / hou / ect @ enron subject : re : stock option questions your position that the general disclaimer on the q \u0026 a of march 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable . if the answer to this specific question , shown below , was that various plans had various periods for exercise , then that should have been the answer to the question , not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years . i , and i am sure many others , made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity . i would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant . i use the term \" expiration date \" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with enron . with regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed , anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger , spin off or sale of a company . special provisions were made to exclude hpl employees from the new all employee stock option plan , special provisions were made to provide a 5 % payment to hpl employees in lieu of the new stock option plan , special provisions were made to consider hpl employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and i feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees . lal echterhoff from march 8 , 2001 , q \u0026 a : \" 1 . with the transfer to aep , will my termination be listed as involuntary so that i can exercise my vested options ? yes , your transfer to aep will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from enron . 2 . what is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options ? the period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination , retirement , death or disability is three ( 3 ) years . \" . from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 30 / 2001 02 : 14 pm subject : stock option questions we have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options . the q \u0026 a dated march 8 , 2001 stated three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program . if you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted under a different stock option plan and that plan carries a three year term of expiration . please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under . additionally , the document was intended to provide general information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review . enron provides the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document . i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which enron determines the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding other employees ' compensation / options .",

The cost is a \"minimum $500 per year\"... but that only accounts for 18 people streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming. Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title (okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and nearly impossible...We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info - which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :( ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sent using Phorum software version 3.2.6",

coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week , establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel . the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal / synfuel spread . the coal cash book , which began trading only two months ago , has traded over 2 million spot tons . the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies , while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal . enron energy and operational services - ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections . because of the culture shock associated the use of the words ' enron ' and ' coal ' in the same sentence , consideration was been given to changing the name to dng ( dense natural gas ) ; however , we went with solid fuel initiative . this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit . the primary areas are texas , florida , southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area . there are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued : brownsville , tx and brighton fl . in brownsville , the team secured formal owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the brownsville ship channel . this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay . a 500 mw facility is being considered for brownsville . as conceptualized , it will consist of two - 250 mw ( net ) cfb units ( circulating fluidized bed ) boilers . the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke ( petcoke ) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible . one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity . there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity . as stated the plant is initially 500 mw , but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 mw facility . the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin \u0026 cheryl kent , project admin assistants , bill fox as pem , and paula solomon as pcm . as the project develops there will be more team members required . in addition , as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team . esource esource , enron ' s research group , recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies . these reports are free and available to all enron employees on the esource hot topics page at http : / / esource . enron . com / hot _ topics . asp . to date , over 1 , 600 employees have downloaded \" spending wisely on private hubs \" , a report valued at $ 2 , 000 . over 1 , 100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports , provided by investext . the reports , which are updated continuously , are presented in folders by company and industry . new folders are being added upon request . to submit a suggestion for a new folder , please complete the suggestion form at http : / / esource . enron . com / suggestion . asp . watch for the new esource bulletin , the source . it will feature frequently requested searches , tips on finding information , new products , services , and events . meanwhile , to further fulfill enron ' s information needs , esource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to enron employees . enron freight markets efm signed a firm contract with streamline shippers association last week to provide truckload capacity for one - year with efm ' s option to extend the contract for up to an additional year . streamline transloads international shipments that enter the u . s . through the ports of long beach and los angeles . streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country . efm will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week . in the news we are pleased to announce that sally beck has been named chief operating officer for enron net works . she will join greg piper , president and chief executive officer and mark pickering , chief technology officer in the enron net works office of the chair . in her current role as managing director for enron net works , sally heads up enron ' s global risk management operations . she brings more than 20 years professional experience to enron , joining the company in 1992 . she graduated from the university of texas at austin with a b . b . a . in marketing and an mba with a concentration in finance . welcome new hires egm -

Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case \nsomething happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of \nthe people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in \nany way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you \nwill lose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this \nworks, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this \nmethod has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have \ntried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get \nall the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to \nbe greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than \nwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.Â  Remember, honesty reaps the \nreward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this \nadvertisement and REMOVE the name \u0026 address of the person in REPORT # 5. \nThis person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their \nfortune.2.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # \n5.3.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # \n4.4.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # \n3.5.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # \n26.... Insert YOUR name \u0026 address in \nthe REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE \nMAKESURE you copy every name \u0026 address \nACCURATELY!==========================================================**** \nTake this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your \ncomputer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just \nin case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the \ninternet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing \ninformation which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find \nthousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to \nget this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL \nLEGALLY==========================================================Let's \nsay that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume \nYou and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that \nthe mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but \nlets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of \nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, \nyou send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders \nfor report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail \neach for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with \norders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 \npeople mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.Â  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders \nfor Report # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total \nof 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for \nReport # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total \nof 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders \nfor Report #5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \nmillion).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \n+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000Â  \nGrand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A \nPENCIL \u0026 PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW \nYOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY \n!=========================================================REMEMBER \nFRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED \nTO.Â  Dare to think for a moment what \nwould happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 \ne-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet \nworldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and \nmore!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE \nINTERNET=======================================================Advertising \non the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to \nadvertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger \nresponse. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as \nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the \nReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. \nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on \nit, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the \nreport.=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================ORDER EACH \nREPORT BY ITS NUMBER \u0026 NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) \nfor each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by \nwrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, \nWrite the NUMBER \u0026 the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \nADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE \nREPORTS NOW!!====================================================\nREPORT # 1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for \nFree on the NetOrder Report #1 from:B.H.218 TimberwoodIrvine, \nCalÂ  92620\nUSA\nÂ ________________________________________________________REPORT \n# 2: The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the NetOrder \nReport # 2 from:Â J.B. \nErhart722 10th StreetPaso Robles, CA. \n93446USA_________________________________________________________________REPORT \n# 3: Secrets to Multilevel Marketing on the NetOrder Report # 3 \nfrom:S.W.131 E.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails \nuntil you do.=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # \n2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash \nwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name \nis moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different \nreport.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \npeople are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER \nBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.Â  There is NO LIMIT to the income you can \ngenerate from this business \n!!!======================================================FOLLOWING \nIS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received \ninformation that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with \nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few \nweeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS \nINSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is \nnow.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put \nyour name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as \ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or \nmore e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.Â  Remember though, the more you send out \nthe more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the \nideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. \nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !============ MORE TESTIMONIALS \n================\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in \nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk \nmail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population \nand percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my \nsupposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made \nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \nthe thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had \nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ \n147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \n''hobby''.Â  Mitchell Wolf M.D., \nChicago, \nIllinois======================================================''Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate \nin this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment \nwas so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \nleast get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post \noffice box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The \nnice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There \nsimply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.\"Â  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, \nCanada=======================================================''I \nhad received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should \nhave given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another \ncopy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 \nmonths passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made \nmore than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.\"Â  Susan De Suza, New York, \nN.Y.=======================================================''It \nreally is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to \nyou. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money \nstarted to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third \nmonth my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to \ninternet.\".Â  Fred Dellaca, Westport, \nNew \nZealand=======================================================ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND \nGET STARTED ON'YOUR' ROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM \n!Â --DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\n",

    "email": "fw : rto week - - state commissioners fyi . tj and claudette - - please send to your groups . thanks - - - - - original message - - - - - from : landwehr , susan m . sent : thursday , october 18 , 2001 6 : 19 pm thursday morning session - - - - meeting with state commissioners this session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at ferc taking action without including them in the decision making process . although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend , upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame . it was a long morning ! i will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts . approximately 35 to 40 % of the commenters were supportive of ferc and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts . most of these comments came from the midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support . everyone else was fairly verbal against ferc , primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process , that ferc was moving too quickly , and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens . in particular , the commissioners from maryland and north carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric . while many would think that the session was extremely negative ( our friend sarah novosel thought it was disgusting ! ) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing - - allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis . here ' s some individual comments : catherine riley / maryland - - - she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the maryland commission and immediately implied that ferc was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens ( she was way overboard in the dramatics department ) . she then stated that she was not at the meeting to \" help you ( ferc ) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record \" . it went on like this for about 15 minutes . the good part is that she was so personally negative , that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her . sam ervin / north carolina - - - he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens , that customer choice is never coming to his state , so he will never benefit from an rto , that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an rto ( and i bet if they do , he ' ll work to change the statutes ! ) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of ferc . his comments were also pretty brutal , but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor . arnetta mcrae / delware - - - she kept on saying \" show me \" where the benefits for consumers are . she also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order . rory mcminn / new mexico - - - repeatedly talked about how the west was different , how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers , how the ferc commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were . carl wood / california - - tried to portray himself and california as representing the west as a whole , and even brought along a statement from the washington commission echoeing his comments . he delivered the same messages that we ' ve been hearing forever - - - ferc should have acted sooner on price caps , etc etc . glen thomas / pennsylvania - - - he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it ' s energy system into the new century . . . that by opening it ' s markets they have had an explosion in green power , they have reduced costs all across the state , etc . he was very supportive of pjm ( makes sense because it ' s in his back yard ) and stated that for any rto to be effective it must have independent governance . judy jones / ohio - - - was very parochial in her discussion , but echoed don svanda ' s comments from earlier in the week that one rto for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the ferc to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed . ed garvey / minnesota - - - he got the gold star for the day . after very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners , he took about 1 minute and said \" ferc - - just get it done \" . . . . in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward . other commissioners who talked were : arthur / connecticut , hadley / indiana , huelsman / kentucky , nugent / maine all on the positive side . other negative commentors were two guys from dc and jim irvin from arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do . from the ferc commissioner standpoint , the gold star went to massey . after hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn ' t feel that they had been included and that ferc had not consulted them enough , he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back , saying the \" there has been 7 years of process , and he wants a process that comes to an end . . . . you ' ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree . . . \" call me if i can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting . sue . # 612 - 339 - 4599",

    "email": "Eugen Leitl writes:\n\u003e Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not\n\u003e enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at\n\u003e least we can't develop and deploy them on time, My estimate is that, in the worst case, we have 17 years (5.4e8\nseconds) to move it one earth radius, or about 6000 km (6e6 m).  \na t^2/2 = x, if I remember right, so a = 2x/t^2, which is \n1.2e7 m/(2.9e17 s^2), or about 4.1e-11 m/s^2, which is not a very\nlarge acceleration, roughly equivalent to the gravitational\nacceleration in these parts divided by 200000000000.  Assuming a\n2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of\nspecific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12\ncubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to\napply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the\nweight of 200 kg here on Earth.So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the\ncalculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about\nfour orders of magnitude too small.If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it\nwould miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1\ncm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,\nor about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not\npossible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,\nas it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could\nstill do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything\napproaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely\nproportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it\nafter half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around\n2.2 cm/s instead.The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide\nsufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away\nfrom the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or\nabout 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).\n(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning\nahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed\nacceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd\nneed four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if\nwe were to start accelerating it now.All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a\nslightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its\ngravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile\nin ways I don't understand.They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being\napplied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which\nis a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five\norders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference\nis probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the\nasteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to\nprovide the needed acceleration?Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other\ndirection, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton\nasteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over\ntwenty-five years to adjust its orbit.***About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better\nsolutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK\nmail to be detained for scanning.

( it 's actually a bit more complicated than that . ) meanwhile i suggest you check a paper by ohala , ' the ethiological use of pitch ' ( i think ) , which appeared in phonetica in the early ' 80s ( again , i think ) . he has done other work on sound symbolism , including a recent book ( hinton , nichols , ohala , eds ) under that name . actually there are two by ohala , both in phonetica , one in 1983 , one in 1984 . . . in yoruba , rugudu ( hhh ) 's mall and spherical ( as buttocks ) ' vs rogodo ( hhh ) ' large and round ( as yams ) ' . if i understood your posting this fits in your ( i . e . the longzhou ) hierarchy . i came across it in child 's paper in the sound symbolism book , the original source is courtenay ( 1976 ) . nb both these words are ideophones in yoruba and there is no suggestion that these two words reflect a productive process , even among ideophones ( though i suspect no one has seriously checked out the possibility ) . dr . bruce a . connell oxford university . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . shoshoni , a uto - aztecan language spoken in the great basin of north america has something like this with demonstratives . there are two sets of prefixes which can be affixed to demonstrative stems ; the first set consists of an [ s ] followed by a vowel and has definite readings , while the second set consists of a bare vowel and has indefinite readings . these are : i ii gloss example si - i - near sit @ n ' this ' se - e - not quite so near set @ n ' this ' sa - a - far , but in sight sat @ n ' that ' su - u - not in sight , far sut @ n ' that ' in addition , there is another prefix which makes no distinction as to proximity , ma - . the forgoing information is taken from a grammatical sketch of shoshoni by the late wick miller , as well as my own field experience with the language . dirk elzinga university of arizona elzinga @ aruba . ccit . arizona . edu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you might want to look at my book for the vector space of vowels . the ordering above is almost a perfect match for a hilbert curve that follows the vowels at the corners of the ordinal vowel cube : hubey , h . m .

We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. \nIndividuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates.

DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.Why do people sell their policies? \nThe reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:Pay off debts \nFund long term care insurance cost \nEliminate costly premiums \nTake advantage of other financial opportunities \nMake charitable contributions \nHelp family members \n \n  \nLife Partners ï¿½Living Solutionsï¿½ \n  \nTraditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death.

It does seem mounted as ext3 after\nthe fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only,\nfsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it. Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it\nto load the initrd ?Kate\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL\u0026 BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate \u0026 administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran\nch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards.

Most of the people that are protesting against taking\nout the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.\nThey simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public\nlisten to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out?

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( \" gccc \" ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the \" act \" ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words \" plan , \" \" confident that , \" \" believe , \" \" scheduled , \" \" expect , \" or \" intend to , \" and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 5 o we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . oo we feel this is our best pick since december of 20 o 4 !

Can we consider them as\n\u003e trusted hardware ?SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec \ndictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used \nfor security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors \nthat make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES \nfaster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael \npointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and \nattackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again \nwhat we've seen is that it's not a question of \"is it secure\", it's a \nquestion of \"who is it secure from and for how long?\" Security is rarely a \nquestion of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather \nit's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are \ndesigned to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the \n$1-20 range (depending on the application).As whether or not they are \"trusted hardware\", the question again revolves \naround attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student \nto have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, \nsay, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad \nEEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is \nlikely \"trustworthy\" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect \nICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, \na risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.-- \nAlex Russell\nalex@SecurePipe.com\nalex@netWindows.org\n",

Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death\nsentence on Houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered\nmillions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding\nunder police protection for a few years.Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to\ncourt under \"hate speech\" laws make a point about people not showin'\ndem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.\nBTW I read Houellebecq's \"Extension du domaine de la lutte\" recently,\nabout a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for\nlove and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get\na friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for\nnutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some\nunbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories\nabout animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted\ninline in full for pages on end.It starts out:\"On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from\nwork.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from\ntwenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting\nundressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all\nthe while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few\nseconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't\nknow what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which\nunderlines the absurdity of her behaviour.After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had\nto go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after\nthat, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty\nat all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and\nread books about the development of language in children, all that\nsort of stuff.\"... and it's downhill from there!\nR\n",

    "email": "come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! ! * * * please read this email to the end * * * try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports . there is my true story . i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) , there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went into this thing ! thank ' s to the computer age and the internet ! be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \" follow the simple instruction \" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' . = = print this now for your future reference = = if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably , please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! ! follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed ! instructions : = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = = for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name \u0026 number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . = = = when you place your order , make sure = = = = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = = you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1 through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name \u0026 address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name \u0026 address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name \u0026 address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name \u0026 address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name \u0026 address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name \u0026 address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name \u0026 address accurately ! this is critical to your success . take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil \u0026 paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the \" cash \" is not because this is illegal or somehow \" wrong \" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number \u0026 name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number \u0026 the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : y . l . wong p . o . box no . 71819 kowloon central post office hong kong report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from : martin veronneau c . p . 70058 laval , quebec h 7 r 5 z 2 canada report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm \u0026 the net order report # 4 from : m . l . frayser p . o . box 61432 fort myers , fl 33906 usa report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : stone evans 600 n . pearl , suite gl 03 dallas , tx 75201 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !

AquilaCalendar is\n   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar\n   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,\n   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize\n   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists\n   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a\n   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The\n   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting\n   organized no more difficult than it has to be.

Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and\n  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second\n  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of\n  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you\n  \"FINANCIALLY SECURE\"?\nIf so, read on:\nThis is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into\n  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a\n  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were\n  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a\n  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price\n  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from\n  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are\n  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career\n  burn out, illness or injury.\nThere was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,\n  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that \"the\n  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.\"\nThe hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age\n  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the\n  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.\nIf you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to\n  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.\nPlease read further:\nWe will show you how you can buy, new, not out of date, products for PENNIES\n  on the WHOLESALE DOLLAR. We will not just send a\n  list, or catalog of where you can buy, but actual point and click DATABASE\n  with hyperlinks to suppliersÃ¿FFFF92 websites and specials pages, with email\n  addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current HOT\n  listings.

Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.Yours faithfully,DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.\n",

    "email": "sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / \u003e / f / \u003e / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / \u003e / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / \u003e / x / \u003e / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the \" fossilized noun-class prefix \" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a \u003e e \u003e i \u003e o \u003e u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",

It doesn't look too hard.Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package\ndid.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I\nknew about Tim \u0026 co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from\n, but I'm not going\nto work on it anymore.I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's\nbooty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe\nhalf an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing the\ndata somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a\nperson can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is\nlooking like my best option.I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which\ndoes the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new\nheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:  train-eggs\n  train-spam\n  trained-eggs\n  trained-spamYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the \"train-\" boxes as you get it.\nHow frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better\nresults if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over\nanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy\nswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of\nthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's\ndone, she moves your mail into the \"trained-\" folders.This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read\ntheir mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work\nabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports\nappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail\nclient to bind the key \"S\" to \"move to train-spam\" and \"H\" to \"move to\ntrain-eggs\".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd\nstart showing up in mail clients.  That's the \"delete as spam\" button\nPaul Graham was talking about.* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word \"ham\" as the\n  opposite of \"spam\", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of\n  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling\n  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as\n  \"eggs\".Neale\n",

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our \" global remove list \" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",

    "email": "commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus . forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis . directors and management dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company . aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation . dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri . viaspace overview viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce . viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems . viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories . the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk . viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate . in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power . viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries -

    "email": "GAMING ADVISOR  NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      \n \nThe general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that \"online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.Â” Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. WhatÂ’s more, there are NO competitors for the CompanyÂ’s method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with\nMajor Casinos Globally.    \n \nMichael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. Â“ The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.Â” A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.\n \ni2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corpÂ’s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued!

    "email": "URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481566\nDate: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using \nsemi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting \ncomputers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone \n    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the \n    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they \n    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a \n    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's \n    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are \n    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an \n    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any \n    international shipping duties on the computers. \"It's what you call real \n    free trade,\" says Eddie Nix.

    "email": "re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis , it may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in \" out \" , \" house \" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in \" oat \" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in \" right \" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between \" writer \" and \" rider \" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in \" eight \" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that \" sorry \" rhymes with \" story \" . this is rare for the words \" sorry \" , \" sorrow \" , \" borrow \" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for \" forest \" , \" orange \" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that 's enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n't want to make anything out of the fact that he 's american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n't hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t 's , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .",

It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,\n\u003e too.By \"meanings have evolved\" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words\nhave changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words have\nchanged? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had\nevolved by time of the Pentateuch?\u003e In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was\n\u003e actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into\n\u003e slavery.This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the\nHebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg\nGen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar\nclaim about the \"real\" meaning of one of the ten commandments:\"\"\"\n\u003e The translations since cause problems at each successive removeWe have the original language versions, though, so this is not an\nissue.\u003e I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment\n\u003e is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,'This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our\nknowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word \"ratsach\". Most modern\ntranslations I've seen translate it \"murder\" but elsewhere the word is\nused\nof an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers\nwouldn't use the word \"murder\").\n\"\"\"\n- http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0163.htmlJames\n-- \n  James Tauber\n  jtauber@jtauber.com\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

    "email": "OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm\n(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature\nfluctuations over the past 400k years).\u003e Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\n\u003e temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\n\u003e correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\n\u003e are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\n\u003e increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\n\u003e preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\n\u003e of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\n\u003e correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\n\u003e causative.Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to\nbe causal.\u003e With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\n\u003e point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\n\u003e regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\u003e As it\n\u003e happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\n\u003e cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.Not correct. Mauna Loa data  and\n show that the current CO2\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine\nresolution).\u003e In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\").Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\nanthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\u003e but it looks a lot like we\n\u003e would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\n\u003e record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\n\u003e concentrations.Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\nspike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\u003e Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\n\u003e affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\n\u003e predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\n\u003e feedback systems mentioned above.Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\nenormous.\u003e Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\n\u003e makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\n\u003e methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\n\u003e basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\n\u003e that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\n\u003e biosphere.Correct.Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htmNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial\nlevels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also\na contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in\nmethane levels as well.Data on water vapor here:\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\u003e CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\n\u003e studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\n\u003e passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\nreducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,\nwind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources\nof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\n(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve\nreductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic --\nAmericans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate\nchange researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last\nyear's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and\nimproved efficiency is an easy sell.- Jim\n",

We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the \u003e Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that \u003e are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\" \u003e \u003e Twain wrote the story, \"The War Prayer,\" in 1905 during the American \u003e occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, \u003e thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it \u003e \"unsuitable\" \u003e for publication at the time it was written. \u003e \u003e # distributed via : no commercial use without permission \u003e # is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, \u003e # collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets \u003e # more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and \"info nettime-l\" in the msg body \u003e # archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net \u003e \u003e --- end forwarded text \u003e \u003e \u003e -- \u003e ----------------- \u003e R.

    "email": "$ 7 money maker and e - mail service please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program !

    "email": "This article from NYTimes.com \nhas been sent to you by luke@applix.com.\nThe mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.\nluke@applix.com\nAfter Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil LibertyAugust 4, 2002\nBy THE NEW YORK TIMES \n This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil\nA. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. In the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John\nAshcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal\ngovernment and \"every available statute\" to hunt down and\npunish \"the terrorists among us.\" The roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with\nwartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions\nof more than 1,200 people suspected of violating\nimmigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or\nfighting for the enemy. The government's effort has produced few if any law\nenforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been\nreleased or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.\nBut it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being\nwaged in federal courthouses around the country, that\nexperts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance\nbetween individual liberties and national security. The main combatants are the attorney general and federal\nprosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,\nimmigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil\nlibertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,\nwith federal judges in between. The government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As\nit has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,\nthe courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed\nback, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's\ntactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.\nFederal judges have, however, allowed the government to\nhold two American citizens without charges in military\nbrigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map\nfor how they might even challenge their detentions. In the nation's history, the greatest battles over the\nreach of government power have occurred against the\nbackdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current\nrestrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by\nhistorical standards and in light of the risks the nation\nfaces. The current struggle centers on three sets of issues.\nPeople held simply for immigration violations have objected\nto new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,\nand they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on\nwhat they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. People brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those\nthought to have information about terrorist plots, have\nargued that they should not be held to give testimony in\ngrand jury investigations. Finally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two\nAmericans labeled \"enemy combatants\" for what the\ngovernment contends is more direct involvement with\nterrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be\nfundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's\nrepresentation and a chance to challenge their detentions\nbefore a civilian judge. So far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered\nsecret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,\nand on Friday a federal district judge in Washington\nordered that the identities of most of the detainees be\nmade public under the Freedom of Information Act. \"Secret arrests,\" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the\ndecision on Friday, \"are a concept odious to a democratic\nsociety.\" A senior Justice Department official said the detentions\nhad been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to\n\"prove a negative\" and cite specific terrorist acts that\nhad been disrupted. But he said that department officials\nbelieved that the detentions had \"incapacitated and\ndisrupted some ongoing terrorist plans.\" Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on\nwhether the government may jail material witnesses while\nthey wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In\nVirginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow\nMr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. \"I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer\nthem on, because they are doing exactly what an independent\njudiciary should be doing,\" said Jane E. Kirtley, a\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota and former\nexecutive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom\nof the Press. \"It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply\nskeptical.\" These lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet\nbeen tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that\nappeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more\nsympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,\nreversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a\nlawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider\nadditional evidence and arguments. But even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the\ngovernment's sweeping argument that the courts have no role\nin reviewing the government's designation of an American\ncitizen as an enemy combatant. The detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of\nthe Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were\ncabdrivers, construction workers or other types of\nlaborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before\nbeing cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. Last month, at a conference held by a federal appeals\ncourt, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the\nClinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant\nattorney general under President Bush, saying that the\nadministration's refusal to identify the people it had\ndetained reminded him of the \"disappeareds\" in Argentina. \"I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the\nmothers marching in the streets asking for the names of\nthose being held by the government,\" Mr. Christopher said.\n\"We must be very careful in this country about taking\npeople into custody without revealing their names.\" Mr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from\nVietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was\ntaken away in 1975 for \"re-education.\" In contrast, he\nsaid, those detained by the United States were not being\nsecretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek\nlawyers. \"These are not incognito detentions,\" he said. \"The only\nthing we will not do is provide a road map for the\ninvestigations.\" According to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than\n1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on\nimmigration charges. Officials said recently that 81\nremained in detention. Court papers indicate there were\nabout two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other\ndetainees were held on various state and federal criminal\ncharges. President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected\nforeign terrorists before military tribunals, though no\nsuch charges have been brought yet. Last month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding\nin Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a\nBritish citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his\nshoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very\nestablishment of those tribunals \"has the effect of\ndiminishing the American jury, once the central feature of\nAmerican justice.\" Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,\nadded: \"This is the most profound shift in our legal\ninstitutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -\nit has taken place without engaging any broad public\ninterest whatsoever.\" Jack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the\nUniversity of Chicago Law School, have written that the\nBush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to\ncivil liberties especially compared with changes during the\ntimes of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What\nhas changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil\nliberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. The Secrecy U.S. Says Hearings \nAre Not Trials Ten days\nafter last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the\nnation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping\ninstructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out\nto be more than 600 \"special interest\" immigration cases. \"Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all\nother cases on the docket,\" Judge Creppy wrote. \"The\ncourtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no\nfamily, and no press.\" \"This restriction,\" he continued, \"includes confirming or\ndenying whether such a case is on the docket.\" The government has never formally explained how it decided\nwhich visa violators would be singled out for this\nextraordinary process, and it has insisted that the\ndesignations could not be reviewed by the courts. But as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and\nMuslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for\nexample at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious\nneighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that\nonly a few of these detainees had any significant\ninformation about possible terrorists. As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of\nlegal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking\nlegal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have\nordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable\nskepticism about the government's justifications for its\ndetention policies generally. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the\nhardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on\nviolations that in the past would not have resulted in\nincarceration. \"Preventive detention,\" he said, \"is such a radical\ndeparture from constitutional traditions that we certainly\nshouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice\nDepartment's say-so.\" Malek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had\nit not given rise to one of the legal challenges that\nthreatens to end the secret proceedings. Mr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa\n14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than\na decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven\nan ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him\nabout a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.\nZeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa\nsoon cost him 40 days in custody. When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his\ndetention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.\nZeidan's cousin and reporters. The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal\ncourt, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.\nIn March, the government dropped the \"special interest\"\ndesignation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,\nand the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration\ncharges against him will be considered in the fall. \"You're one of the lucky ones,\" his lawyer, Regis\nFernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other\nvisa violators were held as long as six or seven months\nbefore being deported or released. Mr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,\nwhich focused on openness, forced the government's hand. \"The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,\" Mr.\nFernandez said. \"We figured if the public had access to\nthese hearings they would see that nothing went on except\nmultiple adjournments and delay.\" Through a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An\nI.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be\nnamed, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's\ncase and in similar cases. He said the immigration service had always detained people\nwithout bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He\nadded that the agency had no choice now but to detain a\nvisa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was\nsure the person was not involved in terrorism. \"Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days\nand then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he\nwas a terrorist,\" the official said. The newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once\nreached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers\ncontain one of the fullest accounts of its position on\nsecrecy and executive power. Its main argument is that the courts have no role because\nimmigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely\nadministrative hearings that can be closed at will. Bennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he\nwas flabbergasted by this suggestion. \"A trial is a trial,\" he said. \"A person's liberty is at\nstake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being\ntold where to live.\" But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,\nDale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for\ncounterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,\noutlined the reasoning behind the government demand for\ntotal secrecy. \"Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous\nin isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist\ngroups,\" he said. This rationale for withholding information, sometimes\ncalled the mosaic theory, is controversial. \"It's impossible to refute,\" Professor Kirtley said,\n\"because who can say with certainty that it's not true?\" In May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal\ndistrict court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,\nruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation\nhearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is\nable to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case\nbasis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the\nmonth before, though that case involved only a single\ndetainee. The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge\nBissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,\nwhich will hear arguments in September, declined to do\nthat. A number of news organizations, including The New\nYork Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in\nsupport of the newspapers. The government then asked the United States Supreme Court\nto stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively\nunusual move given that the case was not before it for any\nother purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting\nthat it might have more sympathy for the government's\narguments. The Witnesses Rights Violated, \nLawyers Contend Late on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled\ntwo nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul\nMohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They\nwere carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000\nin cash and had also shaved their body hair. The agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used\nbox cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and\nhad received letters instructing them to \"shave excess hair\nfrom the body.\" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said\nthere was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian\nmen were involved in, or \"were associated\" with, those\nresponsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. But even though government officials told reporters that\nthe men had been detained as material witnesses, their\nlawyers now say that they were held last fall only on\nimmigration violations. The distinction is important because a material witness\nwarrant brings the automatic appointment of a\ngovernment-paid lawyer, while the government does not have\nto supply a visa violator with counsel. As a result, the authorities were able to question each of\nthe men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer\npresent, their current lawyers say. Like some of the people who were picked up as material\nwitnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails\nin New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.\nAzmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,\ntheir lawyers say. \"It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never\nbring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,\"\nMr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an\ninterview. \"It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney\nat the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.\ninvestigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main\ninquiry into the World Trade Center debacle.\" Anthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his\nclient was interrogated \"often times for several hours a\nday, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire\nquestions from three or four different people.\" Eventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men\nof any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in\nJune in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting\nsentencing. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men\nconsented to questioning. Each \"was read and waived his\nMiranda rights before each interview,\" prosecutors wrote,\nadding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.\nThe United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,\nwould not comment on the specific cases, but said generally\nof the government's tactics: \"I don't see any violation of\nany rule, regulation, or law. \"I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,\" he\nsaid. \"But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every\navailable tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole\nfield and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole\nfield. \"We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate\nand disrupt,\" he added. Today, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen\nmaterial witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being\ndetained. But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred\nintense criticism. Last April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District\nCourt in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law \"to detain\npeople who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in\norder to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of\nthe statute.\" Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when\nwitnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for\ngrand jury investigations. \"Since 1789,\" Judge Scheindlin\nsaid, \"no Congress has granted the government the authority\nto imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that\nhe will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal\ninvestigation.\" Then last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of\nFederal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the\ngovernment's use of the material witness statute in grand\njury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's\nreasoning. Judge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief\nJustice John Marshall that \"the public has a right to every\nman's evidence,\" held that detentions of material witnesses\nduring investigations are proper. The War Captives No Lawyers Allowed \nUnder U.S. Label Yasser Esam Hamdi, a\nSaudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably\nan American citizen by virtue of having been born in\nLouisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind\nof role the nation's courts should have, if any, in\nreviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged\nwith something akin to a war crime. Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in\nNorfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal\njudges who has shown resistance to the government's\napproach that once someone is declared an \"enemy combatant\"\nby the president, all judicial review ceases. Judge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,\nhas twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and\nordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal\npublic defender, to be allowed to visit him without\ngovernment officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar\nsaid that \"fair play and fundamental justice\" require it.\nHe said the government \"could not cite one case where a\nprisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United\nStates District Court, who was held incommunicado and\nindefinitely.\" But the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge\nDoumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the\ngovernment's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,\nmore important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of\nforeign and military affairs. \"The authority to capture those who take up arms against\nAmerica belongs to the commander in chief,\" Chief Judge J.\nHarvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at\nthe breadth of what the government was asserting when he\nasked the Justice Department's lawyer, \"You are saying that\nthe judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's\nstature as an enemy combatant?\" The government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide\nthe court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by\nwhich they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.\nBut the government has argued that judges cannot argue with\nthe standards. Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the\ngovernment closely on those standards. The case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far\nas that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge\nto normal judicial procedures. Mr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like\nMr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig\nafter having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike\nMr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield\nby the military but on United States soil by civil law\nenforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. After his detention as a material witness based on\nsuspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and\ninformation to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred\nto military custody. \"This is the model we all fear or should fear,\" said Mr.\nDunham, the public defender. \"The executive branch can\narrest an American citizen here and then declare him an\nenemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the\ncourts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him\nor giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any\nevidence.\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865\u0026ei=1\u0026en=c82350bcf915e44eHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.

    "email": "\nYannick Gingras wrote:\u003e    I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like \n\u003e unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal \n\u003e from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting \n\u003e executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy \n\u003e problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard \n\u003e to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?What do you mean by \"CD-Key or the like\" (I presume that \"of\" was a\ntypo)? And what do you mean by \"unbreakable\"?You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to\nsolve, and about the constraints involved.Some general points:1. For a conventional \"CD key\" system, where the actual CDs are\nmass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire\nsystem has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys\nbeing \"traded\" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the\nproduct).If there's an online element involved, you can \"tie\" keys to a\nspecific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's\n\"product activation\".2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be\nvulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within\nthe executable.3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to\n\"cracking\", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the\nvalidation checks.This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a\nPalladium-style system).Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only\naccessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a\nmeaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts\nand discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).IOW, you have to \"keep the genie in the bottle\" at all times. If the\ndata can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated\nhardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and\ndistributed without limit.-- \nGlynn Clements \n",

with the first period on a low pitch and the second one higher and much louder . the second period has emphatic stress , i . e . , is higher and louder than the first , which has end-of - sentence pitch and a stress . as for other examples , the only ones that come to mind right now are those involving the decimal system : in french , one says \" sept virgule trois \" for 7 , 3 just as we say seven point three . this must have parallels in other languages . by the way , since you are interested in this , maybe you 'd enjoy hearing the phonetic punctuation routines of the danish - born pianist and comedian victor borge . he has a system of indicating punctuation by means of various mouth-noises , usually as rude as possible , which makes for some hilarious patter . it has been a long time since i heard him , but i believe his records are still available . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * robert dale ( rdale @ microsoft . com ) what 's your take on the use of the word \" parenthetically \" as in parenthetically , i should say here that . . . stretching it a bit further , how about \" item \" in the following ( not at all convinced by this one but just in case ) : there are some things we should get straight here . item : no smoking in class ; item : no eating in class . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \" karen s . chung \" ( karchung @ ccms . ntu . edu . tw ) this happens when certain words are borrowed from the local dialect , ' taiwanese ' ( or ' southern min ' ) , into the standard national language , mandarin , via latin letters to represent the taiwanese sound . e . g . a local variety of lettuce is called in taiwanese e5 a2 chhai3 , and perhaps most people call it by its taiwanese name rather than its mandarin name , wo1 ju4 . but then it became common to represent the taiwanese term in writing thus : a cai4 . people subsequently started pronouncing it like it was written , which is quite unlike the taiwanese compound on which it was based . the same has happened with the taiwanese term for 's pringy ' ( in reference e . g to rice ) : khiu7 became q . this raised the tone from a middle level to high level ( there is no middle level tone in mandarin ) . i can give you a reference on this : hansell , mark ( mhansell @ carleton . edu ) . _ the sino - alphabet : the assimilation of roman letters into the chinese writing system _ . philadelphia : sino - platonic papers , no . 45 , may 1994 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * peter - arno coppen ( u250005 @ vm . uci . kun . nl ) i think the quotation marks can also be expressed by a characteristic intonation pattern ( starting the quoted part with a new tone word , with l * hl intonation ) . also , pronouncing quotation marks with \" say \" seems ( in some cases ) to be appropriate : i think that , say \" intelligence \" , has something to do with it about the origin : in the sixties / seventies , the danish comedian victor borge was rather successful with his \" phonetic puntuation \" , in which he e . g . \" pronounced \" quotation marks with two clicking sounds , accompanied by the finger sign you mentioned . this will surely not be the origin , but i saw many people imitating him since then . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \" dr . christian k . nelson \" ( cnelson @ vm . cc . purdue . edu ) i ' m not sure , but think that what you ' re interested in might overlap with the phenomenon of \" reported speech , \" which bakhtin and his circle dealt with . perhaps there is a better reference for their work , but the one i ' m familiar with is v . n . volosinov 's ( 1973 ) _ marxism and the philosophy of language _ ( cambridge , ma : harvard univ . press ; l . matejka \u0026 i . r titunik , trans . ) . i should note that some believe this book was actually authored by bahktin , but bears volosinov 's name for political reasons . anyway , part 3 seems pertinent to your interests . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * philippe mennecier ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr the same phenomena exist in french : on a coutume de penser que les vrais hommes ( entre guillemets ) ne montrent pas leurs e / motions .

[ ? aj ? i : ] society , [ ? aj ? i : ] the church . . . \" this spoken \" i . e . \" is so common here in the states that , despite being a \" highly literate \" person , i did n't know it meant \" as in \" until a year or two ago when my czech - born teaching colleagues in europe told me . i still do n't believe the two mean the same thing anymore in colloquial speech . people here also pronounce \" e . g . \" for \" for example \" , \" a k a \" for \" also known as \" , and latin abbreviations are often pronounced as written , such as \" et al \" for \" and others \" . the french \" a la \" used in the sense of \" after the fashion of \" is so commonly spoken that i now see it written as a word \" ala \" . the most common rendering of the written quotation marks here is a sort of quickly spoken compound word \" quoteunquote \" , as in , \" he 's not a quoteunquote * real * man . \" ( the emphasis always follows . ) business offices are full of spoken acronyms spoken such as \" cya \" ( from \" cover your ass \" ) to mean a nearly superfluous blame prevention precaution or fact verification measure one takes when doing a particular job ( \" do it as a cya \" or \" this is just a cya measure \" ) . \" kma \" from \" kiss my ass \" , in ad agencies , designates a job people have to do free on their own time , e . g . , because it 's for their boss 's favorite charity ( \" this is just a kma so do n't hurry . \" or \" it 's a kma job , but you still have to rush it , i ' m really sorry . \" ) asap \" as soon as possible \" is pronounced as a word sounding nearly like \" ass at \" . i suppose the classic case of such a thing is the originally military word \" snafu \" , which stood for \" situation normal - - all fucked up \" . check this if it 's useful , but i swear i heard people in the czech republic colloquially using the letters of their abbreviation \" atd . \" instead of the full \" a tak dale \" to mean \" for example \" . closer to what you ' re asking for would be the growing use of the phrase \" question mark \" over here to mean simply something unknown : \" this event leaves a big question mark over the whole project . \" you know , this phenomenon is n't only confined to speech . here is a sentence from the letters column of the january 30 , 1995 u . s . edition of time magazine : \" those of us who have to use pcs at work but choose to have macs at home know that macs , while not problem free , are far and away superior to pc compatibles , period ! \" notice this use of \" period \" followed by an exclamation point . the word period in this usage has been reanalysed to such a degree that it 's not uncommon in the u . s . to hear emphatic statements like the following : \" i ' m not going period ! exclamation point ! \" \" period \" has thus come to mean something like \" in any case \" . americans also say \" slash \" to designate \" / \" : \" he 's kind of a carpenter slash bricklayer . \" \" it 's more or less like a cafe slash bookshop . \" \" if he slash she has a gender , * i * sure can't tell ! \" we also say \" hyphen \" in a similar way : \" he 's an actor hyphen tennis pro . \" also do n't forget the emergence over the last 20 years or so of the term \" bottom line \" , describing the sum of an arithmetic problem or an accounting ledger , and used to mean \" the summation \" or \" the point of the matter \" . in the 1970s i heard it mainly in two set forms , the question , \" what 's the bottom line ? \" ( i . e . , what 's the point ? ) and a main clause \" the bottom line is that . . . \" ( i . e . , what i ' m getting at is . . . ) . now it 's become sort of a complementizer as well , so you hear things like : \" he gave me this big runaround about how his wife was sick , and he had to do overtime at work , and he 's got an exam coming , and all this crap , bottom line he 's not gonna come . \" i ' ve also heard people , who want to end useless heated discussion of something and move on to another point , yell things like , \" wait a minute ! . . . . . new paragraph ! \" some of this stuff almost sounds like people are thinking in comic strip images : \" there 's a question mark hanging over him . \" ( i . e . , his fate is uncertain ) . this is similar to idioms that most certainly have such origins , such as , \" i just saw a light bulb over your head . what 's your idea ? \" the germans read the comma aloud in their decimals much as we here say \" point \" , so american 1 . 0 \" one point zero \" would be german 1 , 0 \" eins komma null \" .",

( new first paragraph , adds additional analyst comment ) by andrew kelly houston , oct 19 ( reuters ) - enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company ' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer . the energy giant ' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years . analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron . \" i don ' t think this thing passes the smell test , \" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . \" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , \" he said . enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities . poor judgment ? analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august . \" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , \" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . \" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , \" he said . enron , north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street ' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent . the stock ' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company ' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform . this year enron ' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company ' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute . moody ' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . analysts said enron ' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead . \" what don ' t we know that went on at that company ? where ' s the credibility ? \" asked one frustrated analyst . \" we don ' t know if it ' s limited to this , \" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones \u0026 company , inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . cut to ` hold ' at a . g . edwards 2001 - 10 - 19 16 : 27 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , oct . 19 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp .

I did an \nNFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot \nfrom CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it \nto it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it \nhandy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted \nthe NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. \nSo I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about \n100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS \nrate.

I've been trying out RedHat Limbo for a few weeks now, \n\u003e equipped with gcc 3.1. I haven't fallen foul of compiler issue so far, \n\u003e that I'm aware of anyhow. That said I'm glad I don't do much C++ - seems \n\u003e pretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the \n\u003e forthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.\n\u003e \ndiary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:\n Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs \nversion of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a \nfew false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the \nkernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 \n(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due \nto broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended \ncompiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs \nstart using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some \nof this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about \n(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, \nit was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined \nbut being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare \nfor anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup \nparticularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large \nparts of the tree). The recent gcc-\u003ec99 struct initialisers patch for instance \nmade large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the\nkernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest...

Some ideas:- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You\n  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then\n  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it\n  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads\n  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only\n  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that\n  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message\n  and that answers \"spam\" or \"ham\".  Then you have a little program\n  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The\n  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the\n  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle\n  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe\n  marshalling.)- Your idea here.Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?

Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a \n   remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. \n \n\t\nDetails:   PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST \n   handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer\n   i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. \n   A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not\n   correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit-\n   ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers.\n   When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers\n   that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation\n   those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous\n   function calls.    On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what\n   will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All \n   possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP\n   will crash when it tries to free them.   Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a\n   solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free\n   chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably\n   the case for several more non IA32 architectures.   Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are\n   running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable\n   to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory\n   managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to\n   overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.\n   Proof of Concept:   e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to\n   the public.\n   Vendor Response:   22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this \n                    vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:                       http://www.php.net/downloads.php                    The vendor announcement is available at:                       http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php\nRecommendation:   If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,\n   especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade\n   for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all\n   kinds of POST requests on your server.  \n   \n   \nGPG-Key:   http://security.e-matters.de/gpg_key.asc\n    \n   pub  1024D/75E7AAD6 2002-02-26 e-matters GmbH - Securityteam\n   Key fingerprint = 43DD 843C FAB9 832A E5AB  CAEB 81F2 8110 75E7 AAD6\nCopyright 2002 Stefan Esser.

    "email": "I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all\nPython platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely\nto offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even\nL|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to\ntheir MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a\nclient-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only\ngoing to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams\nthe incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The\nMUA accesses this \"eThunk\" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is\nretained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual\noversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)\nand the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA\nfetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not\nclear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all\nMUAs can split the host fetch/send URL'sIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If\nthis is available, the \"simple viewer\" could be enhanced to support viewing\nvia folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would\nuse this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best\nn-way classifier uses something called a \"Support Vector Machine\" (SVM)\nwhich is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves\nthe fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could\nbe dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.David LeBlanc\nSeattle, WA USA\n",

preprint exchange 's collection , including the abstracts and tables of contents of an increasing number of philosophical journals , is now available via mosaic and the world wide web . our www server is still under development and is changing rapidly , and at the moment there are still several rough spots , but access to all the ippe materials is in place . due to the rich interface provided by the web , browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe 's structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last \" news from the ippe \" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of \" minimal refereeing \" by the ippe 's international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe 's large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same \" minimal refereeing \" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october 's joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe 's board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange 's ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy of a working paper

' complex construction ' because i do n't think that i share the same view as others on the importance / necessity of this distinction - - indeed , it is a bit ironic that another implication of sapir / whorf is that the view that our language is made up out of ' words ' and ' grammar ' ( constructions ) is precisely the kind of objectification , which we would expect and which formal distributional analyses show to be a simplification ) . as jonathan states , \" figuring out just what counts as a simple , lexicalised form is * very * hard in yup ' ik , given that it has a rich , higly productive derivational morphology \" . i agree and the answer would eventually have to draw lines along continua that i do n't think will be labelled ' lexical ' vs . ' construct ' ( and sapir offered some nice theoretical machinery for these kinds of comparative distinctions too ) . i still see only four ' arbitrary and unmotivated ' forms that deal specifically with 's now ' ( i . e . , snow , slush , blizzard , flurry ) . i ' ll leave it to others to decide whether or not various dialects of eskimo have more or less , but even if the point should fail here it still has life to it . so , i still find myself agreeing with the original insight . the point - - and not all that it has been used to argue - - has always seemed obvious to me . perhaps if we narrow the scope of the relevant speech community and bring it closer to home , it is easier to see . would n't we all accept the idea that _ on average _ lawyers ( vs . non-lawyers ) have more distinct forms for legal concepts than do others outside this community / culture ? ( and , of course , what we mean by distinct forms implies all of the complex relative distinctions hinted at above ) . similarly to take an example i know more about , statistically speaking arabs have more arbitrary and unmotivated forms for camels than english speakers ( even accounting for differences in the syntactico-semantic structures of the two languages ) . why does this simple - - and to be honest relatively uninteresting - - idea seem to bother people so much ? douglas j . glick department of anthropology vassar college doglick @ vassar . edu",

( neologisms are useful in sf , specially in the scientific field ! ) in french , neologisms are made in 5 different ways ( i hope these are the right english words ) : derivation ; composition ; imitation ; pure invention ; amalgam . one might also add borrowings from other languages . here are some examples ( sorry , the explanations are in french ) : - derivation : mot derive : \" position \" peut produire le verbe \" positionner \" ; - composition : mot compose : si \" monotone \" est decompose ( \" mono \" / \" tone \" ) , on peut recomposer \" polytone \" ; a partir de \" telephone \" on peut produire en science-fiction \" videophone \" . - imitation : souvent a partir d ' une onomatopee : a partir de l ' onomatopee \" couac \" on peut parler d ' un \" couac \" ( = un nom ) ; - invention : mot forge : se distingue des autres categories car on ne reconnait dans la morphologie du mot aucun terme existant ( ex . : \" emparouille \" , \" endosque \" , \" pratele \" , \" libucque \" , \" ecorbalise \" - extraits d ' henri michaux ) . cette categorie est contestee car certains pretendent qu ' il est toujours possible de retrouver la racine . - amalgam : mot - valise : reunion de deux mots sur la base d ' une homonymie partielle ; ainsi \" famille \" et \" millionnaire \" peuvent donner \" famillionnaire \" . in the every day french language , the 3 first ( mostly the 2 first ) processes are more frequent and the 2 others are used in the literary ( and humoristic ) discourse . my question ( s ) is ( are ) about the construction of neologisms in english . 1 ) does english use the same processes ? 2 ) even if it does , are the processes of the same importance in both languages ? 3 ) what would be the most frequent ones ? 4 ) what are the major differences ? 5 ) etc . thank you in advance , sylvie berard - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sylvie berard \" but the fact is , i really , really hate d346215 @ er . uqam . ca housework , even when universite du quebec a montreal someone else is doing it . \" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",

day mediation session . although not unexpected , but still disappointing , the judge endorses the market design proposal of the new york and new england isos . this market design proposal encompasses a long , drawn out process for discussing what the northeast market should look like ( minimum 12 months ) before work begins to develop the new rto . the target implementation date of the isos is november , 2004 , but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \" subject to extension \" if new design requirements are introduced . we believe the true intent of the isos is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing iso structures . a copy of the judge ' s report and the business plan are attached . one good aspect of the judge ' s report is that he asks in several areas of the report for commission guidance . we too believe this is necessary . it became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the new york entities ( or the new england iso ) on market design or governance . we argued that ferc intended the new market design to be primarily the pjm system , with enhancements where possible . others , relying on the ambiguity in ferc ' s orders , argued that ferc really intended to create a new system , using pjm as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two isos , regardless of time or complication of creating this new market . we need ferc direction on this , and the judge makes this clear . background the judge ' s primary goal of this 45 - day mediation process was simply to establish a \" business plan \" which lays out how and when a single northeast rto will be created . enron , along with many other participants , opposed this approach , arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the commission . the judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly . although the majority of the judge ' s report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan , he does discuss two substantive issues : market design and governance . market design at the beginning of the mediation , pjm , ny and ne submitted a joint proposal for forming a single northeast rto . this proposal envisions a time - intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders , with an implementation date in 3 - 4 years ( \" option 1 - m \" of the business plan ) . this proposal is now supported by the new england and new york isos - pjm has its own approach ( see below ) . the new york transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new rto in 3 years ( \" option 2 - m \" of the business plan ) . pjm submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single northeast rto with a single day - ahead and real - time energy market by november 2003 ( \" option 3 - m \" of the business plan ) . we took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers , generators , pjm tos , industrials , and other end use customers ( the one rto coalition ) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on pjm ' s system by december 2002 , but no later than may , 2003 . although we ( enron ) believe pjm ' s november 2003 time frame is too conservative , the coalition supports option 3 - m ( pjm ' s approach ) since it achieves the coalition ' s goals , albeit on a slower timetable . as noted above , the judge endorses option 1 - m , in part because it has a built - in a process for determining \" best practices . \" although pjm also conducted a \" best practices \" analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm ' s determinations of what practices from their isos are \" best practices . \" the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) \" far outstrips \" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that \" impatience , haste and greed \" should not be permitted to drive the rto process \" at the expense of sound policy \" and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \" exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . \" see report , page 18 . governance the other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission ' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures . pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) . ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders . we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system . post mediation the judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge . the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared . although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal . please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report . sarah , dan , howard and tom",

You'll be able to boot\nin a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At\nleast those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will\ncontain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you\nneed to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to\n/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs--i386.rpm\n2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs--i386.rpmfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and\nsane.

    "email": "disc : the parameter of aspect \" on the parameter of aspect \" this posting continues the fruitful exchange subsequent to the initial book review of c . smith 's 1991 \" the parameter of aspect \" . in a follow-up to that review , i noted an alternative to smith 's proposal involving a simpler binary parameter for aspect that was in part the basis for my 1995 dissertation on the biblical hebrew verbal system ( u of toronto ) . smith 's reply pointed out the apparent empirical disconfirmation by mandarin and navajo ( treated in her work among others ) ; and this is where we pick up the thread . i do not grant the traditional analysis of navajo and especially mandarin chinese that is the basis of the objection ; nor do i grant the traditional analysis of the \" oriental \" languages including burmese , japanese , and above all , biblical hebrew representing the classical semitic systems . the earliest layer of the quasi-consensus on tense , mood and aspect ( tma ) , flowing from comrie 1976 , 1985 to present , is the early 19th century \" orientalist \" framework that posits ( a ) \" tenseless \" languages or \" inflectional aspect \" systems , and ( b ) a definition of \" perfectivity \" based on the ambiguity inherent in the concept of \" completion \" ( global view as well as relative past tense ) ; on \" oriental \" and \" orientalism \" , see e . g . , e . said 's \" orientalism \" 1978 . i reject the orientalist framework and the analysis of semitic systems which was extended to other \" oriental \" systems , which was extended worldwide to at least half of the world 's systems ; i indirectly reject the traditional analysis of mandarin and navajo . to clarify and make the discussion more concrete , i offer an analysis of english in the orientalist framework ( * please * do not take this seriously as an analysis of english ) . english , as all reputable authorities agree , is \" tenseless \" : it encodes only \" aspect \" ( cf . slavic systems ) . not only do we find arrested development , but actual regression from the robust classical aryan tma systems . english has but one distinction : - ed vs - s / - 0 , respectively perfective and imperfective . the perfective signals \" completion \" vs the non-completion of the imperfective . the severely impoverished system of english signals the regression of the anglo - american mind ( witness reagan and thatcher , etc . , etc . ) . we note several key elements that underlie all traditional analyses of so-called \" tenseless \" languages . 1 ) tma is encoded morphologically on the greek model or not at all : the \" morphocentric fallacy . \" 2 ) the perfective is defined as relative past tense ( bypassing the revolution in aspectology in the second half of the 1800s ) : the \" aorist fallacy . \" 3 ) the relative hierarchy of languages , with greek and sanskrit on top , semitic near the bottom , and now the creoles on the bottom , related to the relative development of \" mind \" and tied to a particular pre - darwinian interpretation of evolutionary theory . english is not tenseless , nor is biblical hebrew or quranic arabic , nor is japanese , nor burmese , nor turkish , nor indeed mohawk or haitian creole . they do differ from the standard european systems : they systematically differ with respect to aspect in mirror-image fashion . this difference is insightfully captured by cowper 's strong claim for a simple binary parameter for aspect : a system default 's for an aspectual interpretation of its simple tense system , either perfective or non-perfective . the aspect not \" defaulted for \" is separately encoded ( cross-linguistically in a limited number of ways ) . european \" tense \" systems default for the non-perfective ( apparently the minority or marked option ) ; non - european \" tenseless \" systems default for the perfective as does english . i simply extrapolate to a strong claim for universal grammar : all systems encode tense ( past vs non-past ; i do not grant a \" future tense \" ) , and at least irrealis / realis ; and in addition the basic system is configured by the binary parameter for aspect . virtually all systems outside of the european sphere default for the perfective according to my studies ; and i assume that is the unmarked setting for ug . the major diagnostic among many is the ( non - ) obligatory expression of the progressive : the perfective default must separately encode the progressive . e . g . , mandarin must express the progressive by the zai v construction ( lit . \" at v \" ) : it defaults for the perfective . navajo and apparently the athabaskan family as a whole default for the non-perfective ( with algonquian systems , the only real pocket of european - like non-perfective defaulters ) . this work is summarized in my \" tenseless languages in light of an aspectual parameter for universal grammar : a preliminary cross - linguistic survey \" , forthcoming fall 1995 , toronto working papers in linguistics . this does not mean that individual lexica cannot increase the complexity of the system , nor that the many interactions between tma and lexical classes are not also parameterized . i ' m only talking about the basic configuration of the tma system for ug . smith is right to point to great complexity inherent in the systems she described in her last posting . re mandarin . the difficulty is what counts as \" inflection \" , and whether \" inflection \" is not infl of standard theorizing . i recognize mandarin - le as inflection ; but not - guo , - zhe ( smith does not mention v - ( yi - ) v , nor does she include v1-v2 compounds ) . the literature i use is divided on the morphosyntactic status of - guo . but - zhe , i think , does not in any way behave as \" inflection \" : see among many sources , li , thompson , \" the meaning and structure of complex sentences with - zhe in mandarin chinese \" jaos 96 . 4 ( 1976 ) . it certainly is not a \" progressive \" ; but is perhaps some sort of \" adjectivalization \" . re navajo . i think the jury is still out on these systems . but rice 's work on slave indicates the lexical nature of several classes of morphemes in the athabaskan verb complex . there is indeed a great deal of complexity here . and since athabaskan is really the only system that does not fall out naturally from my proposal , it deserves great attention . either the whole project falls through , or we learn something interesting about athabaskan systems , or the proposal gets modified in an interesting way : who knows . we learn nothing without strong claims . in summary : i reject any analysis that is \" tenseless \" ; and / or defines perfectivity in terms of relative past tense ( with comrie 1976 ) . these views embedded in the current consensus on tma can be easily traced to the early 1800s and the work on hebrew and arabic . i reject that early framework ( and the not-so - pretty cultural baggage that goes with it ) . in its place i place cowper 's binary aspectual parameter default , and extend the proposal not only to the other \" oriental \" systems but to a strong claim for ug 's tma system . according to my surveys , the only real problem is what to do with athabaskan systems : a project for the near future ( i hope ) . i note that many proposals under other approaches would benefit from the reduction and simplification of terms , concepts , etc . e . g . , bybee et al 's system can be streamlined ; and symmetries emerge that appear amenable to explanation . descriptive / typological work is put on a better footing as well . respectfully , vincent decaen c / o near eastern studies dept 4 bancroft ave . , 3d floor university of toronto toronto on m5s 1a1 canada or decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca",

    "email": "I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html\"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run\non the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\nimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\nbrowser.\"===\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\n\"home\" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\napplications.\"\"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\nconnections can download portions, or \"stripes,\" of a file from several\ncached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles\nthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that\nthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this\ndigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header\nfor the file.\"\n",

( 2 ) i did not respond earlier only because of lack of time . the preference for n-ary comparison , the claim that n-ary is only a multiple of binary , is obviously false , just as the notion that one should not be engaging in comparison if one needs to use a dictionary is obviously false ( alice faber answered that one , that if that restriction had been enforced , our knowledge would be far less than it now securely is ) . both of these supposed restrictions are for the convenience of the linguist analyst , artificially restricting the data available so as to make it seem as if the analyst 's knowledge is more complete for the task than it is , and give a greater ( but artificial ) sense of psychological security . it goes along with the statement by some historical linguists that they \" never want to make a mistake \" . of course none of us do , but some are willing to in order to advance knowledge , and even those who do not want to cannot make themselves immune . the very act of disregarding data which is \" too far afield \" can sometimes lead to mistakes . always possible when trying to * discover * answers when we do not know the answers in advance . rather , we are all human , and gigantic problems will be beyond any of us to completely solve ( attempts at partial solutions do not imply guilt or wrongdoing ) . this in no way implies we should not attempt to solve those problems . we should be tolerant of others ' efforts and use the best part of them , always .

    "email": "So then, Tim Peters  is all like:\u003e [Tim]\n\u003e \u003e My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is\n\u003e \u003e approaching 10 million bytes.\n\u003e \n\u003e That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo\n\u003e records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records\n\u003e aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of\n\u003e UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted\n\u003e before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.That's pretty good.  I wonder how much better you could do by using some\ncustom pickler.  I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of\nwhat I would call bloat:  \u003e\u003e\u003e import anydbm, hammie\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes(\"ham.db\")\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e db = anydbm.open(\"ham.db\")\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e db[\"neale\"], len(db[\"neale\"])\n  ('ccopy_reg\\n_reconstructor\\nq\\x01(cclassifier\\nWordInfo\\nq\\x02c__builtin__\\nobject\\nq\\x03NtRq\\x04(GA\\xce\\xbc{\\xfd\\x94\\xbboK\\x00K\\x00K\\x00G?\\xe0\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00tb.', 106)\n  \u003e\u003e\u003e d.wordinfo[\"neale\"], len(`d.wordinfo[\"neale\"]`)\n  (WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled\nversion of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string\nrepresentation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using\nthe string representation instead of the pickle, right?Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it\nis.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every\nvalue of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a\nton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.Neale\n",

I'm nearly certain that the 4000h+2750s I've been\n\u003e using is way more than enough, though.Okay, I believe you.\u003e Each call to learn() and to unlearn() computes a new probability for every\n\u003e word in the database.  There's an official way to avoid that in the first\n\u003e two loops, e.g.\n\u003e \n\u003e     for msg in spam:\n\u003e         gb.learn(msg, True, False)\n\u003e     gb.update_probabilities()I did that.  It's still really slow when you have thousands of messages.\u003e In each of the last two loops, the total # of ham and total # of spam in the\n\u003e \"learned\" set is invariant across loop trips, and you *could* break into the\n\u003e abstraction to exploit that:  the only probabilities that actually change\n\u003e across those loop trips are those associated with the words in msg.  Then\n\u003e the runtime for each trip would be proportional to the # of words in the msg\n\u003e rather than the number of words in the database.I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if \"all but\none\" testing had any appreciable value.  It looks like it doesn't so\nI'll forget about it.\u003e Another area for potentially fruitful study:  it's clear that the\n\u003e highest-value indicators usually appear \"early\" in msgs, and for spam\n\u003e there's an actual reason for that:  advertising has to strive to get your\n\u003e attention early.  So, for example, if we only bothered to tokenize the first\n\u003e 90% of a msg, would results get worse?Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning\nof the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine.  \u003e sometimes an on-topic message starts well but then rambles.Never.  I remember the time when I was ten years old and went down to\nthe fishing hole with my buddies.  This guy named Gordon had a really\nhuge head.  Wait, maybe that was Joe.  Well, no matter.  As I recall, it\nwas a hot day and everyone was tired...Human Growth Hormone...girl with\nhuge breasts...blah blah blah......",

The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and\noutput) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly\ndesigned systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for\nCSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break\nwith exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)\nbecause of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export\nrules at the time.Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing\nplayer break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They\nrapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm\nwith an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks\nmight have further reduced the strength).  This is another great example\nshowing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed with\nthe greatest of suspicion.\nOn Tue, Sep 03, 2002 at 09:03:40PM -0400, Yannick Gingras wrote:\n\u003e This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.\nThey have \n\u003e an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as\ntrusted \n\u003e hardware ?  Yes and no.  You can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card.\nThere have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards\n(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), and\nsmartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  A\nwell designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely\ncompromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secrets\ncontained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed a\nvariety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,\nincluding unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.\nLuciano Rocha [strange@nsk.yi.org] wrote: \u003e The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the\nrest of\n\u003e the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card,\nor\n\u003e peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.Going back to the original question, once the encrypted material goes\noutside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to \"unbreakably\" protect\nit.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMI\nwatermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.\nWhile there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both in\nterms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.\nSince you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, I\npresume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.  I'm afraid\nmost security measures don't come for free.\nMichael McKay \nDirector of Software Development \nmmckay@iscubed.com   Information Security Systems \u0026 Services Inc. \n  19925 Stevens Creek Blvd. Cupertino, CA 95014 \n  Phone: 408.725.7136  x 4138    Fax: 408.973.7239   www.iscubed.com\n",

( note : marcus nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal , and can be reached at 5 - 8161 to discuss contract issues ) . while the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point , my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours . in fact , they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for standard offer service , so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay , thereby potentially making execution on monday a possibility . attached is a draft dash for this deal . i request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid - afternoon on monday so as to enable us to transact on monday if necessary . the parameters that are still in motion are : ( 1 ) price ( again to e updated monday morning ) , but will maintain same npv value ; ( 2 ) term ( they may end up just going for 6 months ) ; and ( 3 ) exact volume they source from us . as for volume , they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100 % of their requirements for the first 6 months ( they estimate anywhere between 50 - 100 % ) , and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12 - month deal . please feel free to call me ( 978 - 449 - 9936 office , 978 - 448 - 9260 home over the weekend ) if you would like to discuss in more detail . berney aucoin in structuring will be on point to run internal traps on monday as may be necessary . thanks in advance . regards john",

Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.Yours faithfully,DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

i do believe that many traditions ( sexism being one of them ) and perspectives are partially conveyed through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today 's sexist interactive patterns are influenced - - among other factors - - by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master , or subjects their king . this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , using a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by males in our judeo-christian society is not as extreme as during the biblical times , but interestingly it is still inherent to male-specific discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i moved to the bible belt one year ago ( i spent 10 years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me , i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people 's life , the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use . i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer offices , insurance agencies , etc . ) than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u . s . i found this extremely interesting . \u003e ( a ) i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves \u003e believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to \u003e women and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if \u003e it were not accurate ) is what must matter to us as we discuss \u003e sexist language . whether the perception is accurate is of no importance \u003e in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is ? what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research , or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquired schemata ? studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic \" he \" retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural . obviously , the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change ? \u003e ( b ) i do not make any necessary connection between oppression of \u003e womn and oppression of black people at all . i simply used the \u003e example of black slavery as an example of the general principle that \u003e to admit the existence of a form of oppression practiced by some \u003e group ( by white people ) does not mean that one must necessarily \u003e hate them . my point was that i am not a mysandrist just because \u003e i accept that men have historically not been very nice to women . you are absolutely right ! hate does not help any purpose nor does it improve communication . yet , black people needed the cooperation of open-minded white people to help them reach a status based on the principle of equality . the same applies to females who keep trying to communicate with males , and who meet open and understanding men whereas others still believe that sexism is a nonsense political issue brought up by angry feminists . before being a political issue , it is a serious social issue that needs to be addressed through mutual understanding and respect . if males refuse their cooperation , some females may end up hating men as a natural psychological reaction . simone de beauvoir wrote in her book the second sex that there is no black problem yet a white problem ( referring the civil right movement in the us in the 50 's 60 's ) , because so called black issues essentially stem from the whites ' disciminatory attitudes . black problems can be addressed by first revealing the problem of racism , and then by educating people to open their mind to differences as an enriching asset to the society , not a sign of deficiency . likewise , women issues are primarily men issues , because we are still living in a world which has been historically organized by men who believed in female inferiority , whether politically , socially or linguistically . communication between men and women is therefore the key to social improvement , hence the social mission of our research in linguistics , considering that language use is a social phenomenon . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * je pense donc je baragouine . . . . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * lydie e . meunier / department of languages university of tulsa / tel : 918 631 2813 ( o ) lang _ lem @ centum . utulsa . edu / fax : 918 744 1902 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",

Sonnets.William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,\ndramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English\nwriter of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in\nStratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him\nuntil he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed\nquick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a\nmember of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the\nKing's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful\ncareer as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants\nalike.Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the\nwriter's life, leading many over the years to attempt to\nfill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that\nonly result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will\nprobably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses\noffered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;\nilliterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet\n(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to\ntake credit to shield the real writer -- a person with\npolitical ties).Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind\nand heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154\nsonnets involve the author's relationship with various\ncharacters, including a striking young man, a mysterious\nwoman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters\nhave also been the subject of much speculation over the\nyears, despite the fact that they may have been completely\ncreated in the mind of the bard.--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Mickie Kennedy of http://www.poetrypreviews.com\nCopyright DayTips.com, Inc., 2002.

# business and finance data visualization ( data profiling ) ; # automated or assisted map , graph , diagram , or image construction from text or data ; event , process , and knowledge editing and visualization tools ; # and knowledge navigation over databases , texts , and search results . the specific issues addressed by the workshop include but are not limited to : 1 . definition of content : different disciplines and applications have distinct perspectives on what content is , e . g . , of text , video , graphics , collections of interactions or correspondences . 2 . knowledge representation : i . e . , what it is , how to represent it , reason about it , and present it . 3 . taxonomies of content representations , tasks , and visualization artifacts . 4 . representations for content and how these relate to and / or facilitate visualization tasks . 5 . selection and organization of content : deciding what to present and how to organize the presentation of selected content and why ( i . e . , effect ) . 6 . deciding how to coordinate the presentation of content through several media : 7 . the relationship of cognitive task to visualization content and style ( e . g . , visualization structure , properties , form , coherency , interpretability , and accuracy of displays ) . 8 . deciding how to accept and integrate input from several media . 9 . medium - specific encoding of content . 10 . presentation and interaction techniques of generated results . 11 . tailoring visualizations to specific user and usergroup characteristics , knowledge , and interests . 12 . content visualization evaluation metrics and methods . we encourage submissions of demonstrations and / or videos of working visualizations pertaining to the above topics . the organizers will produce a workshop report and , providing there is sufficient interest and adequate results reported , will consider a special edited journal issue and / or state of the art collection . authors are encouraged to submit their workshop papers simultaneously for public discussion to the area intelligence user interfaces of the electronic transactions on artificial intelligence ( etai ) . the etai is a new kind of electronic journal using open and posteriori reviewing . formally , the rules work as follows . in the etai , you first have the article discussed for three months , then you have a chance to revise it based on the feedback , and then you decide whether to submit it for refereeing in the etai or in some other journal . for more information , see : http : / / www . ida . liu . se / ext / etai / . sponsors : sigmedia ( acl 's special interest group on multimedia language processing ) acl / coling program committee : elisabeth andre , dfki saarbruecken branimir boguraev , ibm watson research steve feiner , columbia university michael johnston , oregon graduate institute mark maybury , mitre corporation james pustejovsky , brandeis university steve roth , carnegie mellon university wolfgang wahlster , dfki saarbruecken kent wittenburg , gte laboratories program chairs : james pustejovsky , brandeis university mark t . maybury , mitre requirements for submission : papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use us or a4 letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the acl style file for latex . ms - word users should use the acl style file for ms - word . submissions can be made either as hardcopies or electronically in ascii , postscript , html , or ms - word format . they should be sent to : james pustejovsky cvir ' 98 computer science department 258 volen brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 email : jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu more detailed information on the workshop can be found at : http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp / cvir / timetable * deadline for electronic submissions : march 11 , 1998 * deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) * notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 * final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 organizer information : mark t . maybury , director advanced information systems center the mitre corporation ( ms k308 ) 202 burlington road bedford , ma 01730 tel : 1-78 - 271-7230 fax : 1-781 - 271-2780 maybury @ mitre . org james pustejovsky , associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu james pustejovsky associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 usa voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ rllc",

The only thing to watch out\n\u003e for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again\n\u003e incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).Eeeek... I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc\nwhich hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and\nI'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's\nC++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in\naddition doesn't use namespaces at all.For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a\nreasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva\nor somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site\nitself for this.In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really\nstarted on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib\ndocumentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.Dave.\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list \nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n",

However, if in addition\nhave to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look\nmuch less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup\nthe whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete\naction, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems\nwith this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around\nwithout deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of\nhabit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,\nI'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,\nand at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one\nin the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we\nneed a way to compare two word count histograms, to see\nhow similar they are.  Any ideas ?Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.\nIf they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),\nfalse positives become the senders problem, to rewrite\nto remove the spam smell.In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much\nsmaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be\nslightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from\nthe ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,\nthere's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,\nand we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,\nthat didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from\nthe spam corpus, in case of user ooops.\t/Paul",

' ' ` ` consulting contracts , donations to non - profit organizations linked to directors , this eats away at independence , ' ' said ann yergen , the council ' s director of research . corporate governance standards established by the new york and nasdaq stock exchanges say all audit committee members should be independent . enron board members , including wakeham and mendelsohn , declined repeated requests for interviews . vance meyer , a company spokesman , said enron could not immediately respond to questions regarding the board . compensation enron ' s board met nine times in 2000 with each member receiving annual compensation of $ 79 , 000 in cash and stock . every member attended at least 75 percent of the meetings , except ronnie chan , chief executive of the hang lung group , a hong kong development business , according to company filings . based on enron proxy statements and other documents , the following relationships existed between enron and board members : - - herbert s . winokur jr . , 57 , is the managing partner of capricorn investors l . p . , a holding company that owns the natco group inc . , a maker of oil and gas production equipment . an enron board member since 1985 , winokur serves on the executive committee , chairs the finance committee and was appointed to a special committee created to look into how enron was managed . in 2000 , natco had $ 370 , 294 in sales to enron subsidiaries , or about 1 . 6 percent of natco ' s total sales . ` compromising ' ` ` we think that anything over 1 percent is compromising , ' ' said yergen of the council of institutional investors . enron said in a proxy statement it believes the terms of the sales were ` ` no less favorable than the terms of similar arrangements with third parties .

' ' he was the target of an irish republican army bomb in 1984 that killed his wife and left him buried under rubble for seven hours . enron pays wakeham $ 6 , 000 a month to advise the company on european business . enron ' s audit committee poses particular problems , according to corporate governance experts . the committee is composed of wakeham , mendelsohn , gramm , chan , robert jaedicke , a retired stanford university business school dean , and paulo ferraz pereira , a brazilian banker . wakeham , gramm and mendelsohn are not independent , according to corporate governance experts and standards . ` ` for the audit committee , you don ' t even want the appearance of a conflict , ' ' said charles drott , a forensic accountant who has testified as an expert witness in bankruptcy and business fraud cases involving companies such as delorean motor co . and lincoln savings and loan association . the committee is spread across the globe , with wakeham in london , ferraz in rio de janeiro and chan in hong kong . ` ` the question is why this committee ? ' ' drott asked . ` ` for a big sophisticated company like enron , why did they choose these people ? ' ' swift descent enron ' s rapid decline - - standard \u0026 poor ' s corp . slashed its credit rating eight levels this month to junk status - - centered on its dealings with partnerships the company used to move assets and debt off the company ' s books . many investors had complained enron ' s financial reports obscured the partnerships ' businesses to the point they were impossible to understand . enron ' s former chief financial officer andrew fastow led some of the partnerships and earned more than $ 30 million through their dealings with enron , the company disclosed . enron documents filed with the u . s . securities and exchange commission state that the board determined that fastow ' s participation in the partnerships would ` ` not adversely affect the interests of enron . ' ' the documents also say the board approved all transactions involving partnerships that were brought to it by lay and other enron executives . ` ` what went wrong at enron ?

' s indian lenders may take over its $ 3 billion power venture to salvage loans of $ 2 billion if the energy trader files for bankruptcy in the u . s . enron may be forced into the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history after dynegy inc . walked away from a rescue . rating agencies cut most of enron ' s $ 15 billion of debt to junk status , and its shares are almost worthless . india ' s dabhol power co . , one of enron ' s biggest asian gas and power units , has been mired in accusations of bribery and exorbitant power tariffs . ` ` lenders will have to take control of the project , ' ' said madhav godbole , who headed a panel set up to resolve a payment dispute between dabhol power , enron ' s india unit , and the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . ` ` buyers ( for dabhol ) will have to negotiate with the lenders . ' ' enron , which is owed $ 64 million for bills that are more than 10 months overdue , wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in dabhol as it exits india . tata power ltd . and bses ltd . , the two bidders for enron ' s stake , have said the price is too high . both supply power to mumbai , india ' s commercial capital . the industrial development bank of india , the country ' s biggest lender , and the state bank of india are among local lenders that loaned $ 1 . 4 billion to dabhol . they have the most at stake if the loans turn bad . the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . and other overseas banks is covered by government guarantees , while indian bank loans are not . cancellation notice enron on may 19 issued a six - month notice canceling power sales to the electricity board . the deadline lapsed on nov . 19 as the mumbai high court early this month stopped dabhol from serving the final termination notice until dec . 3 . the court ' s move was in response to a suit filed by indian lenders against dabhol to prevent it from canceling the contract . they were concerned the loss - making electricity board will be forced to buy the power plant , making loan recovery difficult . ` ` the matter has become extremely interesting ( for india ) in the context of dynegy pulling out , ' ' idbi chairman p . p . vora told reporters at the lenders ' earnings meet . ` ` i can ' t say more as the matter is in the court . ' ' idbi alone has lent dabhol $ 400 million . indian lenders won ' t attend a dabhol board meeting or a summit of creditors , both of which are to be held in london tomorrow , vora said , without giving any reason . dabhol ' s board is meeting to authorize k . wade cline , managing director , to serve the termination notice . discount ? enron ' s stake in dabhol may now be worth much less than the $ 1 billion it is seeking . still , potential buyers may find it hard to raise the money they will need to finish work on the plant . construction contractors in june stopped work on expansion of the power plant because they hadn ' t been paid since april . the expansion , which was to add 1 , 444 megawatts of capacity to the existing 740 megawatt capacity , and a 5 million - tons - a - year liquefied natural gas receiving terminal , is 95 percent complete . ` ` buyers may get a good price but they need $ 500 million to complete the project , ' ' said pradyumna kaul , an activist who ' s campaigned against dabhol for eight years . ` ` that is a lot of money for a project that ' s in distress and whose credibility is at its lowest ' ' with enron on the verge of collapse . awaiting ` response ' bses managing director r . v . shahi said he ' s waiting for a ` ` response ' ' from the lenders on the future course of action . ` ` they came to us with ( the project ) and our action will depend on what their approach is . ' ' bses hasn ' t set a price it would pay for the project , shahi said . ` ` we ' ve not reached that stage yet . ' ' tata power officials weren ' t available for comment . ` ` the equity value ( of enron ) will go down , helping potential buyers , but that does not solve the basic problem , that of high - cost power , ' ' godbole said . ` ` all parties linked with the project will have to make sacrifices ' ' to reduce the cost of power . dabhol ' s power charges in 2000 rose as high as 7 . 1 rupees , or 15 u . s . cents , a kilowatt - hour , compared with other suppliers ' rates of about 2 . 81 rupees . that led the electricity board to default on bills , and in may it stopped buying power from dabhol , saying it was too expensive . enron was one of the first major companies to enter india after the country ' s economy opened up to foreign investment in 1991 . it was awarded the contract to build the power plant 100 miles south of mumbai without competitive bidding . plant construction was delayed for about two years after public interest groups filed lawsuits against the project , on the grounds its power was too expensive . a state government reworked the contract just five months after scrapping it , a move that sparked accusations of the company bribing politicians in return for the contract - - a charge denied by all parties . enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) 2001 - 11 - 29 08 : 46 ( new york ) enron bankruptcy would be largest chapter 11 filing ( updatel ) ( updating with instinet share price , dividend payment . ) washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history , forcing the largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate billions of dollars in assets to pay creditors . dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case filed in 1987 . under chapter 11 protection , enron officials could continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . an ` ` automatic stay ' ' under u . s . bankruptcy law would block debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . ` witches brew ' chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard \u0026 zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . shares , the most active in pre - market trading on instinet , gained 2 cents to 63 cents after plunging 85 percent yesterday . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . enron said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a declared dividend . the company is scheduled to pay a 12 . 5 - cent quarter dividend on dec . 20 ` black hole ' for investors now considering buying enron ' s bonds and other debts , a major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the company ' s value . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc . ` ` it ' s a black hole . ' ' deltec has no investment in enron , hindes said . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar , down from 53 cents tuesday . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors , he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase \u0026 co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

    "email": "Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\nboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks \nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \ntechnique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \npercentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you \nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \nreview some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\nZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\nhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a \nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \nof work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \nexecutive working from an office building in New \nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes \nis a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some \nbasic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \nI bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\nwhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\nSo what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? \nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \ncomplete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \nthe 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \nit.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \nDon't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step \nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\nbuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating \norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!

Another search engine \n(can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.http://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/02Dec2002_biz54.html=====\nPostcards from Planet GoogleINTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and \naggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?JENNIFER 8. LEEAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, \ntransfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the \nreceptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es \net poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what \npeople around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The \nterms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, \nFrench, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.The scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a \ncigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto \ntheft fraud how to.Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the \ncollective consciousness of the world stream by.Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet \nconnection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more \nthan 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer \nlogs millisecond by millisecond.Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.So what is the world thinking about?Sex, for one thing.``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking \nat the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. \n(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, \nthough less successfully with foreign languages.)Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much \nof its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble \nto the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what \nthey are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of \nGoogle's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and \nprotecting the data record.Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has \ngiven Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has \nbeen able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including \nmilzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell \nwhich countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and \nGermany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the \nglobalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are \nfar-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost \neverywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race \nand the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last \nyear. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music \nand celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a \nGoogle engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney \nSpears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her \npopularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of \nthe top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural \nliteracy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and \ngirlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list \nrecently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose \nmembers was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and \nfentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages \ntaken by Chechen rebels in late October).The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney \nSpears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them \nunderstand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she \nbroke up with Justin Timberlake.Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more \nserious nature, immediately.On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 \nam local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to \n250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific \nNorthwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and \nCNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, \nNostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that \nNostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive \ncultural seismic meter.The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden \nname'' had surged to the top of the charts.Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they \nwere neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes \nafter the hour.As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. \nWhy would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s \nsitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not \nexplain them.That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena \nper se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a \nmember of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what \nelse is going on in the world.''So what had gone on on April 22, 2001?That night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be \na Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds \nafter the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to \nsearch for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was \nbroadcast successively in each US time zone.The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said \nSergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford \nhelped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. \n``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''Predictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and \nradio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. \nOne of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends \nbefore they hit the radar of other media.As such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or \nretailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for \ncommercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is \ntremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The \nchallenge is defining what we want to do.''Google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data \nbecause of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, \noriginating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to \na specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People \ntell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly \n_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the \naggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.In aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next \nto Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a \nthree-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being \nused around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots \nshooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey \nthe impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest \nflames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.Each country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy \nhave a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely \nlunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when \nphone rates for dial-up modems drop.Google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and \nphenomena as they hop from country to country.Take Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in \nSpain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking \ndance similar to the Macarena.Like a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated \nthrough Europe over the summer and fall.The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 \ncountries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches \nbegan a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the \nNetherlands.Haven't heard of Las Ketchup?If you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.\n===rgrds,\nBernard\n_______________________________________________\nIIU mailing list\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\n",

( b ) exclusivist , but not particularly secretive youth-specific slang , so-called \" youthese \" , among teenagers ( adolescents ) , functioning as peer , in-group , or clique trademark . i have received a great deal of very useful information . i have not attempted making a summary earlier , because new responses kept coming in ( i suppose , i chose an inopportune time to send in my query , when most people are on vacation / holidays ) . having now also recieved the material one respondent said she would send me after returning from a journey , i can now proceed with the summary : the responses also included new leads to further search , and the following is a total summary . i first of all want to thank all the responders and contributors for their bery helpful and informative messages : jannis k . androutsopoulos \u003c androuts @ novell1 . gs . uni-heidelberg . de \u003e jack aubert \u003c jaubert @ cpcug . org \u003e rick mc callister \u003c rmccalli @ muw . edu \u003e bill fisher \u003c william . fisher @ nist . gov \u003e tim jake gluckman \u003c tjgluckman @ aol . com \u003e jack hall \u003c jhall @ uh . edu \u003e marion kee \u003c marion _ kee @ cs . cmu . edu \u003e nobuko koyama - murakami \u003c koyamamu @ hawaii . edu \u003e nathan sanders \u003c sanders @ ling . ucsc . edu \u003e nik taylor \u003c jnataylor @ pcola . gulf . net \u003e markell r west \u003c markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil \u003e mark a . wilson \u003c maw @ annap . infi . net \u003e sorry if i missed somebody ( 1 ) first , the direct respondents to my original query : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - rick mc callister : called my attention to the fact , the pig latin was the term more commonly used for what i called \" double dutch \" , and also gave me the url of his www spanish pig latin page : http : / / www . muw . edu / ~ rmccalli / spigpayatinlay . html the www page is very informative . it also suggested a new venue of search , which proved quite fruitful , i . e . i started to search the internet for mentionings of \" pig latin \" , see ( 2 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bill fisher : one good example of this , which you may already be aware of , is \" boontling \" , a jargon that was developed in the 19th century in marin county , california . i ' ve got a pretty decent book on it , \" boontling , an american lingo \" , by charles c . adams , u . of texas press , austin , 1971 , isbn 0-292 - 70082 - 2 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tim gluckman : when i was at school in the ' 60s - in stockport , england - i recall that oneschoolgirl clique in my year spoke one of these insider languages . one day i asked one - they were all in my schoolyear - of the more ansprechbar of these recently pubertied schulmaedchen what they were saying . as far as i can recall it , her explanation was that their geheimsprache included a variable substitution of t / d - perhaps other consonants too - before the end of the word . it certainly had the affect of of rendering their conversations incomprehensible . this is the only time i ever came across it ; c . 1964 / 5 . they spoke it for 6 months as far as i can recall . whether it went on beyond that i do n't know ; these girls were in the middle of three streams at the grammar school 15 kilometres south of manchester where i went to at that time . and on a question of mine indicated , they were at an age where they were actively dating with boys . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - marion kee : there was a discussion on linguist ( i think sometime in 1995 ) about pig latin and related topics ; i think there were examples cited from a number of different languages . the discussion might have included a list of references . to find it in the linguist archive , try searching on \" pig latin \" and / or \" egg latin \" ( in egg latin , every syllable gets the syllable \" egg \" added prior to its vowel ; e . g . , \" eggegg leggateggin \" - - \" egg latin \" . english only , as far as i know , and my ex-husband learned it when he was 10 or 11 , in athens , ohio , usa . ) this suggestion too opened a fruitful venue for further search , see ( 3 ) below . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nik taylor : my cousins , my brother , and i had a code called flip-top . you started out by flipping around pairs of letters , double letters being counted as one , and adding - ot to consonants and nothing to vowels , doubles being indicated by \" squared \" , so \" hello \" - \" e hot o lot-squared \" . she and her friend had invented it as \" tot \" ( i think that was its name ) , and it was just adding - ot to consonants and the \" squared \" part , so \" hello \" - \" hote lot-squared o \" , i added the flipping part . ( 2 ) rick mc callister 's www page suggested a search for other such pages , but i only found one , that of nathan sanders : http : / / ling . ucsc . edu / ~ sanders / research . html which also was very informative on language games , referred to as _ ludlings _ , but i wrote the owner and got further information : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nathan sanders : a good place to start would be the work of bruce bagemihl , who has done a lot of work in the area of ludlings / language-games . here are two references on ludlings . the first has a large list of examples , while the second has more explanation of the ludling phenomenon itself : bagemihl , bruce . 1989 . ` ` the crossing constraint and backwards languages .

! ) we ' re talking at least 40 years here , but the strange thing is , i can actually visualize the item that i read , and the page on which it was printed , although i certainly do n't know the title of the book . i am sure that it was written for people my ( our ) age at the time , not for adults . i remember that , even while i was reading it , and although i was only about 10 years old , i was aware that the description of the \" language \" was not sufficiently detailed in treatment of matters such as consonant clusters or sequences . i ' m pretty sure that \" st \" would be treated as a cluster , with one \" op \" inserted after it , not an \" op \" after the \" s \" and another \" op \" inserted after the \" t \" . thus \" stay \" would be \" stopay \" , not \" soptopay \" , but i remember that at the time i was aware that i was not sure how such a word would be treated . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nobuko koyama - murakami : japanese ba-bi - bu-be - bo language ( or lingo ) was used by teenagers . ba - bi-bu - be-bo language was specifically used when they . . . . . . . were teasing or joking with others , wishing to make their conversation sound so secretive , and purposely annoying others . manipulating this language so skillfully was a key to the membership of this group . if you mimicked this language poorly , you would be automatically excluded from the group . one more thing : there were some variants in use of this language . differences seemed to be strongly related with types of dialects ( of japanese ) they spoke . in the northern part of the mainland japan , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted accordingly based on phonetics . in the tokyo metropolitan areas , ba-bi - bu-be - bo was inserted between orthographic letters ( at least such was a tendency that i had found ) . e . g . , \" icecream \" ( written as a-i - su-ku - ri - : - mu ) nb \" : \" represents lengthening mark in japanese orthography here . 1 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-bi - mu-bu ( tokyo ) 2 ) a-ba - i-bi - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bi - i-mu - bu as far as i know , the age group that i mentioned ( those were teenagers in 80 's ) were in the rage of 15-18 ( which means that they were in high school at that time period : nb in japan , unlike u . s . , high school is legally and clearly a separate institute ) . we all encountered and experienced this ba-bi - bu-be - bo language when we were high school students . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mark wilson : it 's been several years since i observed the phenomenon i told markel about ( the german insertion of \" lav \" after vowels ) . german : \" lav \" inserted after vowels . \" ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg \" for \" ich wohne in bad homburg \" to be more precise , the insertion was \" lavv \" , where v stands for the vowel immediately preceding the ( inserted ) \" l \" . = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3 some tentative conclusions : ( a ) both phenomena , pig latin - type phonologically manipulated secret language , and youth slang , are apparently neither an anglosaxon , nor a european particularity . ( b ) predeliction to pig latin - type language game covers a much wider age bracket than i had initially suspected , beginning at around 10 years , and overlapping with youth slang , in which pig latin - type expressions may be taken up as slang - specific words . thanks again to everybody who contributed . perhaps i should apologize that this summary got so long , but to be honest , of course , i am very happy to have gotten so much to summarize , and thought it would be selfish not to share it with fellow linguist - listers and future searchers of the linguist archives . for this same reason , here are my own experiences with pig latin : at age 12-13 years , in indonesian junior middle school ( smp ) in bogor , west java , i encountered ( took part ) in the following form of pig latin : sentences were constructed to preferentially consist of bisyllabic words ( most basic words in indonesian are bisyllabic ) , and when the first syllable ended in a consonant , the entire second syllable was replaced by _ se _ ( _ e _ as in english \" were \" ) , otherwise the initial consonant of the second syllable was retained and only the rest replaced : _ saya cinta sama kamu _ \" i love you \" ( _ c _ as engl . _ ch _ ) became : _ sayse cinse samse kamse _ from other people i know that similar indonesian pig latins had existed in other parts of indonesia , particularly in central and east java . most of the ones i heard of had the _ se _ insertion , but the rules were not always exactly like in bogor in my childhood . it was only used occasionally , particularly to tease those who were not \" in \" to the secret . it was a passing fad which lasted not even as long as one school year . finally , i understand that some time around 10 years ago , in israelian pop-music there had been a hit , which also became popular outside israel , particularly in west europe . the title seems to have meant \" i love you \" in pig latin - style manipulated hebrew . can anyone tell me anything of that song , but particularly of the hebrew pig latin ? does anyone know anything about pig latin e . g . in chinese , hindi , tamil , arabic , turkish , or suaheli ? does youth slang exist in amerindian languages , in australian aborigine , or other languages of pre-industrial communities ? best regards to all , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdi tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",

    "email": "THE WEEK IN REVIEW: Harvest at MacworldÂ Search\n\t                Â \n\t                Â \nNews.com\n\t                All CNETÂ Â Â Â \n\t                The Web\n                Â Live tech help NOW!\nApril's tech award\n1 million open jobs\nNews.com: Top CIOs \nZDNet: PeopleSoftCNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW\nThe Entire Tech Week in a Single Email\nSaturday, July 20, 2002Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.\nApple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.Microsoft's moves\nNot one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.\nNot everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.Somebody's watching youYou better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as \"mocha\" and \"eval\" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as \"Web enhanced\" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.\"Mocha\" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing \"mocha:\" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.\nOn the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.\"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,\" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.Also of note\nA handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are advancing techniques once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, in ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping networks than were previous efforts...Apple released the final version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is planning to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restrict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction fraud, a Virginia man was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for life prison sentences for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, a group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, finalized licensing terms for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manageable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are considering a joint venture to pepper the United States with wireless \"hot spots.\"Want more?

    "email": "proposed decision the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readers digest version of the order . susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday , and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementation / documentation . jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor gray ' s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didn ' t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved . he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter . susan , mark and i spoke about this idea later , and we ' ve got some reservations about tw ' s role in admonishing the cpuc . we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything . bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state , california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas \u0001 , ( socal ) system . in his draft decision , bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case , the less far - reaching interim settlement ( is ) , submitted in december 1999 . socal , san diego gas and electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is , reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year . but since then , gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state , prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name . the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements . recent events \u0001 \u0026 lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation , the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm , tradable intrastate transmission rights , should be delayed , \u0001 8 according to the draft order . \u0001 \u0026 this unbundling is the basis of the [ comprehensive settlement ] and we cannot approve it . we do not , however , wish to commit to paralysis until 2006 , as the [ post - interim settlement ] would have us do . accordingly , we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption , with modifications , of the is . \u0001 8 the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge , calif . , with rolled - in rates if certain criteria are met . el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socal to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of curtailments oc - curred . el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheeler when only certain customers would benefit . the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion , but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process . the draft decision would also : \u0001 \u0007 end socal \u0001 , s current \u0001 \u0001 \u0007 establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations ; \u0001 \u0007 institute an operational flow order ( ofo ) procedure . provides a forum for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made ; \u0001 \u0007 set up \u0001 \u0001 \u0007 make changes to balancing rules , while retaining the current 10 % monthly imbalance tolerance ; \u0001 \u0007 make socal \u0001 , s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules and penalties as all other shippers ; \u0001 \u0007 allow some limited imbalances trading , as well as the right to assign and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market , with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it ; \u0001 \u0007 unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding that required for core minimum reliability ; and \u0001 \u0007 provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs . in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates , eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for participating in core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core aggregators . bilas \u0001 , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market conditions . bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft . \u0001 we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers if more competition is allowed , \u0001 8 bilas wrote in the draft decision . \u0001 \u0026 with half the state already committed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re - structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this time . with one leg in the water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not foolhardy , to reach our goals by forging ahead . \u0001 \u0026 we choose to take a cautious approach again , \u0001 8 the draft continues . \u0001 \u0026 rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with modifications , the settle - ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer protection legisla - tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs . \u0001 8 the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc - turing in the future \u0001 \u0026 but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers . \u0001 8 all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be discussed . the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc \u0001 , s dec . 21 meeting .",

trading companies . investors appeared worried that enron ' s recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy - trading market . the houston energy powerhouse , with annualized revenue topping $ 150 billion and assets of more than $ 60 billion , handles transactions representing roughly one - quarter of the nation ' s traded - electricity and natural - gas volumes . in less than two years of operation , its enrononline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $ 880 billion in transactions . \" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , \" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . \" there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . \" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . \" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , \" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow \" will be on a leave of absence from the company . \" he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that \" management does care \" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as \" an admission of guilt . \" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \" death spiral \" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with \" trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , \" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . ' ' but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . ' ' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you ' ll never get any answers .

quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a \" chinese wall \" existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \" informal inquiry \" into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a \" hold \" to a \" sell \" rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . \" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , \" mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a \" sell \" recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price . \" we are concerned about what we don ' t know , \" ms coale said . she was concerned that enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating , or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet . enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure . enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the sec inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong . lex , page 16 .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the \" fastow era \" is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, \nWindows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so \nI ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \nwrite more about what I learned.   One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \ninfested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Click here to download now!Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still\ngetting record downloads for our first\nFREE Gnometome. What does\nthat mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make\nmore. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services\na little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who\ncouldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your\ndata transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you\nget featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls\nto its knees. We're still sitting\nat #5 on Amazon. If we ever\nhit #1, I'll eat my hat.

It's time for a paragraph\nI like to call: \"Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL.\" They\nwent out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this\nevening. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"How kind of them,\nChris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's\nissue. They must have read your mind!\" No, they must have rented a\nlist of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop\nthere. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER\nmarketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty\neye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)\nbusinesses in the future. It's my \"direct\" way of saying: you're\nnot the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?\nI didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people\nfrom around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more\njunk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,\neither. See what you get when you tempt fate?My good buddy, Bill,\ntells me that Speakeasy.net\nprovides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I\nsign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,\ntoo: \"Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they\nencourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When\nlooking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home\nServices' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k\nupstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that\nis less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start\nlooking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!\" And Stuart Portner is\nchock full of common sense: \"Remember that a lot of DSL providers\ngive you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at\nleast for initial setup / shakedown period.\" All the more fries\nfor me, dude!\nSee You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â \nÂ GnomeCONFERENCE\n$99 Pre-Registration / $150 At The Door\nÂ GnomeDOWNLOADSToday's Downloads\nAppPlus 3.24\nEaseBackup 3.70\nHotCrypt 4.12\nArles Image Web Pa 4.94\nSmasher 2.9.12\nThe Bat! 1.61\nWinSafe 1.1.2\nPrivacy Eraser 1.68\nZero Popup 3.0\nWinPulse 1.01Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.toteboard.net/Models/company_overview.htm\n{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the\nbest thing to do with your money is to invest and then \"forget\nabout it.\" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that\nlikes to play the stock market.

With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the\n\"Shortcut to\" and \"Copy of\" prefixes from all my files, making\nthem a lot easier to read.

I hate it even more when the program doesn't\nleave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say\nI am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows\nInstaller, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for\nany program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging\nthrough the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ Software \\\nPolicies \\ Microsoft \\ Windows \\ Installer. Add a new String\nvalue, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:\n\"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any\norder: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =\nStatus messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error\nmessages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =\nAction-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit\ninformation; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you\nadd a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an\nexclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,\nI just have to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log\nfiles. They'll vary in name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and\nend with the .LOG extension.

    "email": ". . . . . use hypnosis to make money ! hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , \" i lost 15 pounds \" or \" i quit smoking . \" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying \" they \" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis \u0026 relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking \u0026 other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name \u0026 number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .",

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart \nwas racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive \nultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head \nwith blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not \ndiseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general \nartery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they \nwere sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the \nheart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very \nwell. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I \nasked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does \nit mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really \nnot much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the \nones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an \nangiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass \nbecause of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part \nof my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026lr=\u0026ie=UTF-8\u0026oe=UTF-8\u0026safe=off\u0026q=carotid+arteries\u0026spell=1\n[2] http://www.vascularweb.org/doc/190\n",

It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\nJohn Roberts of the association said: \"It has obviously been very well\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\nhorn cut out of carpets.\n\"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\nnot get another refit for another year.\n\"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle Â­ a tractor and trailer or a\nlorry Â­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.\"\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\nwhitening.\nMr Roberts added: \"The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\n\"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\ntake it away again because it was a major job.\"\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\n\"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\nhas not been a cut in the turf Â­ which would be much more of a problem. It\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.\"\nAn RCA spokesman said: \"Some people in the country are getting very\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\ndon't seem to be doing anything good.\"\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: \"The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.\"\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.------------------------ Yahoo!

I find it annoying, though, that\n \u003e\u003e alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently\n \u003e\u003e running kernel.\n \u003e\u003e\n \u003e\u003e So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the\n \u003e\u003e \"TARGET_KERNEL\" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You\n \u003e\u003e still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at\n \u003e\u003e least it doesn't have to be currently running. It's kinda hackish, so\n \u003e\u003e if someone has a better way to do this, let me know.\n \u003e\n \u003eThat idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what\n \u003eyou sent doesn't support packages named \"kernel-smp\"). I'd also prefer a\n \u003ecleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...\n \u003eprobably \"--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp\". Sound good enough?\n \u003eThe BuildRequires on \"kernel-source\" will also need to be removed because\n \u003eit won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/\tMe and my kernel rpm builds ... this all works along the same idea I have \nbeen aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump \n...\tIf we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole \nlot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms \nare huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...\tI will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working \nidea ...Thanks guys.\nMailed\nLee\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list \nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n",

    "email": "sum : ' this ' and ' that ' dear colleagues : last week i sent a query to this list asking you about the fomral opposition between ' this ' and ' that ' in the demonstratives ( june 4 , 6 . 772 , qs : ' this ' , . . . ) . i have received 26 responses by now , and so think it necessary to compile a quick summary today as i will be away from tokyo for more than two weeks starting tomorrow . the original text of my query was as follows : some present-day ' european ' languages have only one set of simple demonstratives and the opposition of ( this ) vs . \u003c that \u003e is expressed by the help of ( here ) and \u003c there \u003e : french ceci ' this ' ce livre-ci ' this book ' cela ' that ' ce livre-l ` a ' that book ' swedish det ha \" r ' this ' den ha \" r bilen ' this car ' det da \" r ' that ' den da \" r bilen ' that car ' estonian see siin ' this ' see maja siin ' this house ' see seal ' that ' see maja seal ' that house ' my sweidish - german dictionary ( stora tyska ordboken ) gives ( der hier ) and ( der da ) as colloquial ( familia \" r , umgangssprachlich ) german forms which conrrespond to ( den ha \" r ) and \u003c den da \" r \u003e , respectively . how common is a demonstrative system like this ? incidentally , japanese has a rather sophisticated three-way distinction here : kono hon ' this book ( you see here ) ' sono hon ' that book ( you see there ) , the book ( under discussion ) ' ano hon ' that book ( you see over there ) ' so i ' m afraid i will have to convince my students that the japanese are extravagant even in the way of using demonstratives . though the last paragraph was intended as an allusion to the way japanese tourists spend money overseas , quite a few people , both japanese and non - japanese , took it seriously and tried to convince me that the japanese language ( sic ! ) was by no means \" extravagant \" because it was not alone in having a three-way distinction in the demonstratives . some even drew my attention to the existence of a language with a five-way distinction . i thank them for the examples of various demonstrative systems they sent me , but this is not the point i wanted to discuss . perhaps i should have stated explicitly that i was interested in the morphology of demonstrative pronouns / adjectives . it is very important that french , for instance , has one basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective , i . e . ( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or \u003c there \u003e in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( \" den tiden , \" \" det aaret , \" \" de fraagorna \" ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding \" der \" ( \" tag den bog , \" \" naer saa du de mennesker ? \" ; \" hvad er det der ? \" , \" jeg tager dem ( der ) \" ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the \" den der \" forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use \" this here \" and \" that there , \" as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with \u003c der dort \u003e , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with \u003c this \u003e and not with \u003c that \u003e ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and \u003c jenes \u003e ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there . ' ' this book here ' vs .

I've heard Bush say this (verbatim)\nGLM\u003e more than once, and with a straight face.Personally, I don't know where you got that from.  Here's how I\ngrokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was\nthe propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not\nin the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.\nHe listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the\nauthor meant to come off at the point that you seem to be\nconjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly\ndidn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not\ninclude some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an\nearlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.GLM\u003e Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and\nGLM\u003e lies to justify violence against a creature genetically, morally and\nGLM\u003e intellectually indistinguishable from your sister.  Go ahead, peel the\nGLM\u003e skin off a random daughter of each of them and lay them side by side\nGLM\u003e on the pavement, and you tell me which one was racially guilty, which\nGLM\u003e one carried the \"infection\" the \"plague\" (note, not the \"antigen\" or\nGLM\u003e the \"hormone\", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,\nGLM\u003e but they chose the fear-charged words)This article never got into the bones \u0026 blood of what humans are Gary.\n  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.\nI'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.\nThat there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about\nthose who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how\nthe world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a\npsychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who\nfantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into\nthat distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because\nyou believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're\ngoing to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle\ngame in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from\nthe rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that\nmoment.GLM\u003e \"Make no mistake about it\" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate\nGLM\u003e it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to\nGLM\u003e /excuse/ \"our\" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'\nGLM\u003e ourselves of \"them\", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its\nGLM\u003e hate.\nI didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where\nyou saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.\nI'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he\nmeant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common\nfather with a football complex dream) he should have included our\ndelusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you\nget 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)\nobjects... ?GLM\u003e What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  Lots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad.  :)GLM\u003e Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour\nGLM\u003e are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact\nGLM\u003e more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+\npeople.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into\nperspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a\nwhole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_\nmuch like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and\norganized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on\nthe road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your\nchildren with Jesus, but its not equivalent.The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed\npeople.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While\nthe aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label\ncan be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different\neffects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?\nJust a father-son complex gone terribly awry?GLM\u003e What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima\nGLM\u003e gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this\nGLM\u003e planet?  They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly\none.GLM\u003e What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like\nGLM\u003e our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for\nGLM\u003e trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make\nGLM\u003e it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/\nGLM\u003e /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs \"fundamentalist islam\",\nGLM\u003e and they call ours \"imperialist satanism\"?GLM\u003e When both sides can call the other \"evil\" to the cheers of their local\nGLM\u003e public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No\nquestions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I\nthink the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are\nfolks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about\nthe 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the\nmade-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or\nprotections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over\nothers.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy\nthat we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very\nclever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,\nGary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.\nI won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but\nI'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.GLM\u003e I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I\nGLM\u003e understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.Too bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies\nof people, yours or others.\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed\n\u003e\u003e (especially those with multiple email addresses...).\n\u003e\n\u003e What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.\n\u003e\nAh the great spam debate wages on ...So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is\nthat I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school\naccounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of\nmail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go\nthrough it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends\nthat go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into\nthe friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  \nIts still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I\nhaven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my\ncarey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets\nconsiderably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.\nWhen I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or\nwhatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even\n_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change\nmy mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I\ncan send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to\nmy @hotmail account.I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only\nfork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting\nto feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be\nwilling, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist\nprovided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was\nreferenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us\ntend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the\nwhole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more\nknowledgable.My half a cent here...: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving\nthing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)\nWoo hoo!

They can grow to 4ft in length.\nAnyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence\non 08705 555 999.------------------------ Yahoo!

- bridging the gap and enhance the trade-off between theoretical models of lexical knowledge and applications in nlp systems . these goals are justified : - by the increasingly central position that lexical knowledge , and in particular lexical semantics , is assuming within the general architecture of cognitive systems , both as a dynamic module which interact with other non-linguistic sources of knowledge , and as a component playing a major role in interfacing syntax and semantics ; - by the fact that lexical resources ( such as tagged corpora , computational dictionaries , machine readable dictionaries , wordnets ) are among the most crucial aspects of practical nlp systems . issues concerning the structure , the representation , the development , and the acquisition of lexical knowledge are thus of the uttermost importance when building nlp systems . lexical systems also play a crucial role in the design and construction of multilingual systems , a key feature at least for applications designed to operate in a distributed , non - centralized environment such as the world wide web . this second edition of wlss will focus on the portability and reusability of lexical systems , and on the issue of word sense disambiguation and semantic tagging . we also encourage the submission of papers concerning more general issues about linguistic lexical semantics and its interaction with computational lexicography . abstracts are invited for 30 - minute talks . here follows a non - exhaustive list of topics which could be addressed : * lexical resources for semantic tagging and word sense disambiguation . * use of lexicons and thesauruses to improve information retrieval / extraction techniques . * automatic acquisition and management of lexical resources . * reusability and tuning of existing lexical resources for novel tasks . * trade offs between generic and domain specific lexical resources . * multilingual lexical resources . * description and evaluation of existing tools and systems . * evaluation of different representation formats . * issues in computational lexical semantics and computational lexicography . * issues in the design , construction and use of lexical resources . * architecture for a cognitive plausible lexicon * lexical representation and the interface with syntactic processes * * change * * extended deadline for submissions * * change * * only electronic submissions are accepted . abstracts should not exceed 2 pages in length , in postscript or ascii format , and should be sent to the following address : wlss98 @ celi . sns . it . separate information should be sent , including the title of the talk , author 's name , address and affiliation . submissions must be limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author . the deadline is : 20 january 1998 . the program committee intends to publish a selection of the papers presented at the conference . * * change * * important dates * * change * * submission of abstracts : 20 january 1998 notification of acceptance : 28 february 1998 conference : 6 - 7 april 1998 program committee pier marco bertinetto ( scuola normale superiore ) nicoletta calzolari ( ilc ) luca dini ( celi ) vittorio di tomaso ( celi ) alessandro lenci ( scuola normale superiore ) bernardo magnini ( irst ) fabio pianesi ( irst ) frederique segond ( xrce ) antonio zampolli ( ilc ) contact persons for every further information please contact the conference secretariat : vittorio di tomaso celi ditomaso @ sns . it alessandro lenci scuola normale superiore lenci @ alphalinguistica . sns . it scuola normale superiore laboratorio di linguistica piazza dei cavalieri 7 56126 pisa ( italy ) tel . + 39 50 509219 fax : + 39 50 563513 more information on the workshop and a copy of this call for papers is available on the web at the following address : http : / / celi . sns . it / ~ wlss98",

    "email": "functional phonology , paul boersma new from holland academic graphics : functional phonology . formalizing the interactions between articulatory and perceptual drives by paul boersma in functional phonology , paul boersma develops a theory that seeks to explain and describe the data of the languages of the world from general capabilities of human motor behaviour and perception . by separating the roles of the articulation and the audition of speech sounds , it predicts and clarifies generalizations about the organization of human speech , and solves several outstanding controversial phonological issues . providing a synthesis between the \" phonetic \" and \" phonological \" standpoints , the theory of functional phonology expresses explanatory functional principles like the minimization of articulatory effort and the minimization of perceptual confusion directly in a descriptive formal grammar , and offers a typologically and empirically adequate alternative to generative theories of autosegmental phonology and feature geometry . the subjects covered in this book include articulation and perception models , constraint-based accounts of phonetic implementation , the acquisition of articulatory and perceptual phonological feature values , an algorithm for learning stochastic grammars , the construction of phoneme inventories , circular optimization in sound change , and a determination of the fundamental principles that underlie the surface phenomena sometimes ascribed to the primitive phonological operations of spreading and the obligatory contour principle . this book will appeal to phonologists interested in the possibility that the grammar directly reflects common principles of efficient and effective communication , to phoneticians interested in the idea that phonetic explanations can be expressed as constraint interactions in a formal grammar , and to any linguist interested in the innateness debate . contents : introduction part i . representations 1 . representations and features 2 . articulation model 3 . acoustical simulation 4 . perception models 5 . test of the articulation model part ii . constraints 6 . functional optimality theory 7 . articulatory constraints 8 . perceptual contrast and faithfulness 10 . acoustical faithfulness 11 . typology and the local-ranking hypothesis 12 . corespondence 13 . degrees of specification part iii . grammar 14 . learning a production grammar 15 . how we learn variation , optionality and probability 16 . inventories 17 . sound change 18 . the obligatory contour principle 19 . spreading 20 . conclusion 1998 . xii + 494 pp . isbn 90 5569 054 6 . paperback .

    "email": "george aditjondro dr george aditjondro , a prominent indonesian academic at satya wacana university in salatiga , central java , remains at risk of imminent arrest for his peaceful academic and political activities . he was not arrested on 8 october because he was not in the country at the time . he has since returned , and on 12 october , dr aditjondro received a second summons on charges of \" insulting a government authority or body \" , under article 207 of the indonesian criminal code , a charge which carries a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment . if detained , dr aditjondro would be a prisoner of conscience . the second summons requires him to report to yogyakarta police at 10am on 15 october . it does not clarify whether dr aditjondro is wanted as a witness or a suspect . if held and questioned as a suspect , dr aditjondro could face prosecution and imprisonment . the pretext for the charge against dr aditjondro appears to arise from comments he made during a panel discussion at the universitas islam indonesia ( uii ) in yogyakarta in august . amnesty international believes , however , that the authorities are attempting to punish dr aditjondro for his past criticism of government policy relating to human rights and environmental concerns in indonesia and east timor and , further , that the charge may be intended to prevent him from taking part in peaceful activities prior to and during the asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) meetings which will be held in jakarta in mid - november . amnesty international is also concerned that , since the issuance of the first summons on 5 october , dr aditjondro has been subjected to intensive surveillance by military intelligence officers from the resort military command ( korem ) in salatiga , both at his home and his place of work . under indonesia 's code of criminal procedure ( kuhap ) , the police and not the military , bear sole responsibility for the arrest of suspects . since military intelligence authorities have no lawful role to play in dr aditjondro 's case , amnesty international considers their activities in recent days to be a form of harassment . background information the charge against dr george aditjondro is symptomatic of a marked escalation in official harassment and intimidation of alleged government critics in recent months . these measures have included prevention or breaking up of meetings and seminars , the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists , and the torture or ill-treatment of some political detainees . human rights violations against labour activists are a part of this pattern . muchtar pakpahan , the chairman of the independent trade union , sbsi , is currently on trial along with at least nine others , accused of \" inciting \" workers to demonstrate and to strike . amnesty international believes that use of these measures against alleged government critics has increased in preparation for the apec meetings in november , which will attract considerable international and domestic media coverage . further recommended action : please send telegrams / faxes / express and airmail letters : - expressing concern that dr george aditjondro remains in imminent danger of arrest for the peaceful expression of his views ; - urging that the charge against dr aditjondro be immediately and unconditionally dropped ; - expressing concern about the current level of intimidation and harassment of alleged government critics , including academics , lawyers , journalists and human rights activists . appeals to : minister of state : drs moerdiono [ salutation : dear minister moerdiono ] menteri negara jl veteran no 17 jakarta , indonesia faxes : ( c / o - foreign ministry ) + 62 21 36 0517 or 7781 or 7782 telegrams : menteri negara , jakarta , indonesia military commander region iv / diponegoro : brig gen soerjadi [ salutation : dear brig gen soerjadi ] pangdam iv / diponegoro markas besar kodam iv diponegoro semarang jawa tengah , indonesia telegrams : pangdam iv / diponegoro , jawa tengah , indonesia chief of police yogyakarta : gen ( pol ) drs madra s banurusman [ salutation : dear gen ( pol ) banurusman ] kapolda yogyakarta markas besar kepolisian diy yogyakarta , indonesia telegrams : kapolda yogyakarta , indonesia please send copies of your appeals to : his excellency mr junus effendy habibie , embassy of indonesia , 38 grosvenor square , london w1x 9ad [ please see the responses to this topic for the addresses of diplomatic representatives in other countries ] and , if possible , to the following : minister of foreign affairs : ali alatas sh menteri luar negeri jl medan taman pejambon no 6 jakarta , indonesia faxes : + 62 21 36 0517 or 7781 or 7782 chair of the national commission on human rights : ali said sh ketua komisi nasional hak azasi manusia jalan veteran no 11 jakarta , indonesia faxes : ( c / o ministry of justice ) + 62 21 314 1625 please send appeals immediately . please do not send appeals after 10 november 1994 . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + + if you have any queries about this urgent action or about + + the ua scheme in general , please contact : + + ray mitchell + + amnesty international british section + + 99 - 119 rosebery avenue + + london ec1r 4re email : rmitchellai @ gn . apc . org + + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +",

one of these is a generic intro to linguistics ; the other is a course surveying the languages spoken in the usa , including immigrant languages , american indian languages , and dialects of english and spanish , covering phonetics , history , and sociolinguistic issues , among others . finally , we will have openings for advanced graduate courses in some of the subfields represented in our department - - such as phonology , phon-etics , psycholinguistics , computational ling . , syntax , semantics , specific language areas ( such as african , american indian , etc . ) for these advanced graduate courses , we are primarily interested in hiring relatively senior people with established repu-tations ( e . g . people who are on leave and who are interested in visiting ucla ) , though more junior applicants will also be considered . because we have a large number of courses available for visitors to teach next year , we are quite flexible in terms of the type and level of appointments . in particular , we may be interested in hiring some people for single-course lectureships ( paying in the neighborhood of $ 7 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 per 10 - week course , depending on seniority ) ; we may also consider full-time appointments for periods of one or two terms , with a courseload of 2 courses per term , and pay levels per course roughly comparable to those mentioned above . finally , we may make appointments with less than full-time teaching loads ( e . g . teaching one course and co-teaching another ) . these visiting positions are not restricted as to rank . we are especially interested in hiring faculty from other universities who plan to be on leave during ( part of ) the coming academic year and who may be interested in visiting our department for part of the year and teaching a course ( or two ) while they are here . each course runs for ten weeks ( with two 2 - hour lectures per week ) followed by an exam week . appli - cants should send a letter of application , including a cv , a statement of previous teaching experience , as well as the names , addresses , and phone numbers of three recommenders to : tim stowell ( chair ) , dept . of linguistics , ucla , los angeles , ca 90095-1543 . ( actual letters of recommendation should not be sent at this time ; likewise candidates should not send voluminous dossiers of publications , etc . ) applications for fall quarter courses should be received by aug . 15 1997 , and applications for winter and spring quarter courses should be received by sept . 10 1997 , though late applications will also be considered as long as the positions remain unfilled . potential applicants are strongly encouraged to inform us by e-mail , as soon as possible , of their intention to apply for these positions . initial inquiries by email may be directed to tim stowell ( stowell @ ucla . edu ) or to anna meyer ( meyer @ humnet . ucla . edu ) . eoe . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = fyi ( \" for your information \" ) / / cheers , ach = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e alan c . harris , ph . d . telnos : main off : 818-677 - 2853 professor , communication / linguistics direct off : 818-677 - 2874 speech communication department california state university , northridge home : 818-366 - 3165 spch csun fax : 818-677 - 2663 northridge , ca 91330-8257 internet email : alan . harris @ csun . edu www homepage : http : / / www . csun . edu / ~ vcspc005 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =",

The one I\ngave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to\nbe scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for\ndelivery.As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load\nbalancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10\nbefore the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to\nbelieve that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10\nnever goes down. Why?

    "email": "3 . 417 citations i can't resist putting in my tuppence worth on chomsky 's citation record . here are my very informal observations of how he is treated by non ( theoretical ) linguists . ( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor 's much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c 's theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c 's views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in \" the mind 's new science \" , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in \" aspects \" and in the non-technical parts of \" knowledge of language \" . it 's surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into \" government and binding \" . - philip swann",

( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . . . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - \u003e $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists . some list \u0026 bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade ! about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal \u0026 lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! note : if you need help with starting a business , registering a business name , how income tax is handled , etc . , contact your local office of the small business administration ( a federal agency ) for free help and answers to questions . also , the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium - size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

( not that it is really important ) . some people replied with examples of languages with object affixes , whether or not the languages in question also had affixes indicating other grammatical relations . matthew dryer replied with the following list of languages which have object affixes but no subject affixes ( taken from an a database mentioned by him in language 1992 ) : africa : central khoisan ( nama ) , ijoid ( kolokuma ijo ) , gur ( bimoba ) , east chadic ( kera ) , biu-mandara ( margi , mbara ) , west chadic ( ngizim ) . eurasia : nax ( ingush ) , avaro-andi - dido ( avar ) , lezgic ( archi ) , munda ( mundari ) . se asia oceania : nicobarese ( car nicobarese ) , central-eastern malayo-polynesian ( kiribatese , ponapean , woleaian ) . north america : pimic ( papago ) . south america : warao , maipurean ( palikur ) . i have not been able to follow up on all of these refs . i have however , looked at the micronesian languages . 3 ) discussion of a few languages sohn ( 1975 ) re woleaian : object suffixes , but no affixes corresponding to any other grammatical relation . 3sg has three forms : zero and - y / - w . it seems that verbs fall in to two classes , with zero being added to verbs in one class ( many of whose members appear to have a tr suffix ) and - y / - w to members of the other class ( the choice in forms being phonologically conditioned ) . interestingly , 3pl distinguishes animate vs inanimate , whereas all other persons and numbers do not . these affixes can occur with or without an overt independent object np . these affixes occur on certain post-verbal advbs , suggesting that they might in fact be clitics . zewen ( 1977 ) re marshallese . pronominal objects immediately follow the verb . 3sg and 3pl are enclitics and undergo vowel harmony . these enclitics can co-occur with lexical np object . ' subject ' prons are all independent . groves , groves and jacobs ( 1985 ) re kiribatese . it seems from their description that the language has object suffixes but no other affixes indicating grammatical relations . however , there are things which could perhaps be analyzed as subject prefixes ( p1 08 ) . exactly which object suffixes get attached ( out of 11 classes ) seems to be lexically determined . 4 ) general discussion it would appear that there are no cross-linguistic studies of object affixes per se . some respondents questioned whether the object suffixes in roviana are really suffixes and not just clitics . they are suffixes , but even if they were n't the focus of my interest would be the same . i am focussing on two facts about roviana : ( a ) the case marking on np 's is on an ergative-absolutive basis , but the only grammatical relation indicated by verbal affixes is object . ( b ) of the object affixes , only 3pl has zero form . being functionally inclined , i am interested in finding a motivation for ( b ) . it is not simply a case of referentiality ( see the brief sketch below ) . 5 ) refs ( with diacritics mangled by the internet ) corston , simon h . 1993 . ergativity in roviana . ma thesis : auckland university , new zealand .

' ( animals , 034 ) ( the paper i am writing now clarifies why i only put erg in parentheses - it is really unmarked , and you have to infer in this context that the pron = erg because there is no particle ) kote arina tie mae magu-i - 0 sarini fut pl man come carve - tr-3pl . do 3pl . abs ' the men will come and carve them up . ' ( feast , 016 ) ( them = pigs in a feast ) nb , here the do is the pron sarini . however , you can get the affixes even if there is no overt do np , suggesting that they have independent reference , e . g . ai lul-i - u mo intj follow - tr-1sg . do dt ' hey ! follow me . ' ( animals , 011 ) and the following longer example . e saimone sa tie he-hegere hoirana . pers simon def man dup - laugh there ' that 's simon , the man who 's laughing over there . ' avos-i - a xoi ? hear - tr-3sg . do you ( erg ) ' do you hear him ? ' ( day , 029-030 ) note that the suffixes do not ' index ' absolutive etc , only o . ( see ma ) roviana has case marked and quantified np 's . case ( erg , abs , obl , etc ) is indicated by articles before the np . quantifiers ( numbers , 's ome ' , ' all ' etc ) precede the head n . non - specific undergoers obligatorily occur in a backgrounded object construction . compare the following two examples . raro talo si gami cook taro abs 1pl . excl ' we cooked taro ' / ' we did some taro cooking ' it is difficult to say if ' talo ' is ' incorporated ' since there are no other indep elements assoc with the verb which ever come after . note that the backgrounded constr is intr , with no transitive marking , and with the actor as s . compare to the ' usual ' order vao raro-a gami sa talo cook - 3sg . do 1pl . excl def taro ' we cooked the taro . ' undergoers which are pragmatically backgrounded can also occur in the backgrounded object construction , irrespective of whether they are referential or not . 7 ) summary * languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . * i feel that having 3pl as the only zero form is unusual , but am unable to find a cross-linguistic study to bear this out . even so , the zero form requires a functional explanation ( cf du bois , john w . 1987 ' absolutive zero : paradigm adaptivity in sacapultec maya ' , lingua 71 : 203-222 ) . again , my thanks to those who replied . ps i should have a draft of my paper ' featuredness and core arguments in roviana ' available shortly . simon corston corston @ humanitas . ucsb . edu",

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \nother things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \n10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \nconvinced myself that â€œit's not that badâ€ and trudged through it \nall without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll \nbe back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \nvocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so \ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \nquestions written in English. â€œHow do I include personal information in \nmy RSS feed?â€ is a goal-oriented question. â€œCreate a FOAF file \nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \nfeedâ€ (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \ndictionary.[1] http://www.peerfear.org/\n",

    "email": "summary of q : articles two weeks ago i posted the following query : ) a system of articles is an innovative feature of a number of languages . are ) there any examples of languages that have lost their articles ? i would also ) be interested in creoles , especially , say , if both ( all ) source languages ) had articles , but the pidgin / creole turned out lacking them . thanks to the following for responding : lars borin david gohre john e . koontz jeff marck deborah d . kela ruuskanen achim stenzel shigenori wakabayashi dave wharton of the 8 replies , only one was an actual response to my query . lars borin ( lars . borin @ ling . uu . se ) pointed out that ) finnish romani is a language which has lost its articles completely . the ) loss is almost certainly due to finnish influence , as are many other ) traits of modern finnish romani morphology and syntax . moreover , as ( colloquial ) finnish may seem to developing an article system using the demonstrative * se * ' that ' ( def . ) and the numeral * yksi * ' one ' ( indef . ) , it is interesting to note that lars has ) noticed in finnish romani texts that there are forms of the demonstrative ) pronouns 'd auva ' ( this ) and 'd ouva ' ( that ) , which are ) ( a ) reduced phonologically and indeclinable ( reduced versions of the ) nominative plural ) ; the forms are : 'd ala ' and 'd ola ' ( while the ) nominative plurals of 'd auva / douva ' are written 'd aala / doola ' ) ) ( b ) used much as spoken finnish 's e ' , i . e . perhaps representing the first ) ( or maybe second [ . . . ] ) stage in a development from demonstrative to ) preposed definite article . importantly , the definite articles used to be ' o ' ( sg masculine ) , ' i ' ( sg feminine ) , and ' e ' ( plural , both genders ) , hence nothing like the demonstrative pronouns . now , let me elaborate somewhat on my reason for inquiring into this matter . disregarding massive language contact ( i . e . \" hey , this is the way we say things around here , and you 'd better start doing so too ! \" ) and / or creolization ( i . e . \" ok guys , let 's start all over again . we ' ll begin with lexical categories , then . . . \" ) : if it were the case that there is a universal tendency that languages acquire articles , but do not loose them , then why should this be so ? if we take a configurational approach to noun phrase interpretation , we could say that articles , and hence their semantics , are associated with a noun phrase internal functional projection in much the same way as some linguists would assume an association between tense ( and other verbal inflections ) and a clausal functional projection . ( in essence , i ' m talking about some kind of a dp - analysis . ) since possible noun phrase interpretations differ minimally across languages ( i guess ) , we would then assume that in languages without articles , the functional projection associated with the semantic properties in question would have phonetically empty heads . the possible tendency of acquiring articles could then be explained as a strive to fill this / these head / s with overt elements . unfortunately , i cannot say that i so far have any reason to be convinced about this line of reasoning , but i can't see any obvious reason to give it up either . however , i am ready to be butchered . i should probably read the following references provided by john e . koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) ) greenberg , joseph h . 1978 . how does a language acquire gender markers ? pp . ) 47-82 . in : universals of human language , vol . 4 , ed . jos . h . greenberg , ) et al . stanford , ca : stanford university press . ) discusses evolution of gender marking from articles and articles from ) demonstratives . see also : ) greenberg , joseph h . 1981 . nilo - saharan moveable-k as a stage iii article ) ( with a penutian typological parallel ) . journal of african languages and ) linguistics 3 : 105-112 . those interested in definiteness , especially with respect to english and finnish , should consult the following work provided by deborah d . kela ruuskanen ( druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi ) . ) chesterman , a .

He might have dreamed of becoming an\nace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to\nuse the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring\ndifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, \"you\ncan't get the chicks with that anymore.\"The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\nsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech\nbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\ncome to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\n2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled\ninto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of\nComputing Machinery.\"I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\ndeclines,\" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering\nat Princeton University in January. \"It can be hard to see this, because at\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\nexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.\"At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington\nUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\nscience fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\npast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and\ncomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing\nResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees\nwere awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\nfastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other\ncomputer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among\ncollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\ncomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is\ndown to 800, although a newly created and more general information\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students.\"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,\" said Lloyd Griffith,\ndean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.\n\"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four\nyears on something and then not get a job.\"Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major\nis expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does\nnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of\nComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major,\" Halperin said. \"That's a\nfactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.\"Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not\nconvinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,\nwith a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his\nadvanced-placement exam in computer science.\"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things,\" Yandziak\nsaid. \"I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world.\"Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of\nAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.\"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the\nsame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this\nkind of IT training right now,' \" Miller said. \"Our concern as an industry\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the\nroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to\nfind themselves in a shortage situation.\"Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other\nfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social\ninfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perception\nof computer science as an isolating, \"nerdy\" profession is one that many in\nthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.\"All the hipness is gone,\" Yandziak said. \"Once we thought of the Internet\nas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that\ncame along.\"Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\nthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\nmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.\"Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,\"\nThompson said. \"To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a\nnecessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.\"\n",

    "email": "accents : linguistnet in the news since victor raskin kindly kept me supplied with the responses he received to his july 6 query about the westfield accents petition , i was unusually well prepared to respond when a reporter meredith o'brien phoned me july 8 to ask if i had an opinion as a linguist on the matter ; when i told her about the linguistnet discussion of it , she was quite surprised and interested to learn of the existence of such a thing , and it turned out her ediotr was too , and the result was an article which is as much about linguistnet as about accents . the first such that i know of . i contacted victor to get his permission to use what i 'd gotten from him , but of course neither of us could contact quickly enough the many linguists whose responses i was faxing to the newspaper . i figured , and victor agreed , that messages sent to linguistnet are more or less public , and that in any case this was a very good and positive opportunity for us to do some educating of the public , which we are always looking for opportunities for . i certainly hope everyone who was quoted in the article agrees that i did the right thing in making the linguistnet discussion available to the reporter . i think the reporter did a good job of it . here 's the text of her article : springfield ( mass . ) union - news , westfield edition , friday , july 10 , 1992 , p . 1 linguists criticize accent position by meredith o'brien westfield - victor raskin , a linguistics professor at purdue university in indiana , was quite perplexed when he saw an article in his local newspaper about westfield 's petition to prohibit instructors with accents from teaching elementary school students . \" has anybody else seen a weird piece in the newspaper about a measure taken by the greek mayor of a small massachusetts town with a very ethnically mixed population to prevent people with foreign accents to be employed as grade school teachers , \" raskin asked subscribers to a linguistics computer network this week . \" besides killing my own chances of ever teaching grade school over there , is this measure nonsensical linguistically ? \" he queried . responses to raskin 's question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called \" linguistnet \" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee 's curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee 's attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition 's organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee 's decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into \" linguistnet \" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . \" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher \" , she said wednesday . \" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . \" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents ' accent . many others agreed . \" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , \" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . \" but all their children had strong ' towny ' accents . \" \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , \" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . \" kids get their accents from their peers , \" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher 's english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . \" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , \" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . \" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . \" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we ' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : \" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of \" consonants and wowels , \" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she 'd listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher 's accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ? only if you try to make it a kantian universal . make it a principle , and you ' re stuck willy-nilly with language panels , ethnic spokespersons , teachers ' union reps and , of course , lawyers . before it 's over , people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines , and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for re-election . the problem , of course , will remain unresolved . as they say in massachusetts ( or would if they thought of it ) , some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher 's \" universal law . \" some kant .",

    "email": "bilingualism i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory \u0026 practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu",

Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief\nsecurity advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the\nperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the\nadvent of a new democratic\ndispensation in the country under the leadership of\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under\nsevere persecution due to the sensitive position he\nheld in the last military regime, presently he is\nunder house arrest restricted only to the confines of\nhis village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a\nbusiness proposal that might be of interest to you. My\nclient has informed me of the existence of funds\ndeposited with a security company abroad. This fund\ncame about as part of security votes that were\nallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure\nas chief security adviser to the then president. What\nhappened was that he had part of the funds transferred\nfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this\nsecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal\nsecurity outfit of the\nthen president. But before the purchase could take\nplace the president died. My client has decided to\nkeep this for himself as all his properties has been\nconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his\nincarceration he cannot travel out and effect the\nchange of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for a\nforeign partner that can help him facilitate the\nchange of possession. The deposit certificate and the\ncode needed for the execution of this endeavor are in\nmy possession.The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand\nUnited States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.I remain most obliged.Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).\nPrincipal Partner.

Can you say\n\u003e\"Bootstraps\", boys and girls? I knew you could...\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nSure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when \nthe data in their own list\ncontradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the \"inherited, \ngrowed\" entries. I guess if\nI read it enough times my vision will clear.\u003e[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,\n\u003elike, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught\n\u003eyou in a government-run \"high\" school, you'll probably get more of\n\u003e*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get\n\u003earound to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\n\u003etransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's\n\u003egovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\n\u003einnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\n\u003esummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\n\u003ethere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003eThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n\u003e\"terminal\" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\n\u003ebest school possible.\n\u003e\n\u003eWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\n\u003efor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,\n\u003eask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\n\u003eyears for proof.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nI, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning \nthat tuition was \u003e 20K,\nno financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this \nsmart person decided\nthat I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee \n(non-refundable). During attendance at\nmy local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for \nit - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it\nhas nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European \n(and Canadian) business\nschools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used \nthe words \"American nobility.\"\u003eMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\n\u003eWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\n\u003eChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\n\u003egoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\n\u003eafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\n\u003ecouldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\n\u003elast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\n\u003eand \"biased\" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\n\"invented\" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess \n\"practically\" gets you\naround that problem.\u003e\n\u003eThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with \"terminal\"\n\u003edegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\n\u003elearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\n\u003ebasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\n\u003edeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\n\u003ewho don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\n\u003esmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\u003e\n\u003eBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\n\u003erhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to\n\u003ebeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\n\u003ewere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\n\u003eMissouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,\n\u003emuch less a \"terminal\" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on\n\u003ethis list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with\n\u003eeducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\n\u003efacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\n\u003eThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\n\u003eeconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\n\u003eignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\n\u003eintelligence and effort.\n\u003e\n\u003e[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\n\u003ecompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\n\u003eapparently.]\n\u003e\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nIts interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent \nstudy found that college graduates\nearn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). \nThey did decline to mention\nthat the demand for some trades  is so great that some of\nthem are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - \nthe average salary for\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \n21,000  -- \u003c $14,000 US. No wonder\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \ncenters that\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \nto this is that many college graduates\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \nthat we are the thin edge\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \nthird-world wages and work practices coming\n to North America.I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\nwith my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large \nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\nThat's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \nplace.And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \ngenerous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about\nthe labor markets here.\u003e\n\u003eBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n\u003e*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\n\u003eall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\n\u003ethere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\n\u003emost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n\u003e*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\n\u003eall of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\n\u003enot \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\u003e\n\u003eThat efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\n\u003ePeople's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\n\u003estuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\n\u003eapparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd\n\u003eknow about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase\n\u003ein general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about\n\u003eextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\n\u003edoesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\n\u003epolitician as Santa Claus come election time...\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nMuch as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I \nhave difficulty finding any - except of course for\nlabor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well \nunless the supply is tight)\nIt was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the \nself-made billionaires on\nthe list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the \nconcept of \"more stuff, cheaper\"\nwhich it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly \ngalling example is\nhigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that \nit is an area where the pricing\napproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the \ntelecom industry (maintain your\nmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through \nthe same regulators) meet.\nSadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole \nentertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing\nseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer \nseems less important than using\nregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to \nproduce profits for the favored few.\u003e\n\u003eIn short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\n\u003etheft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and\n\u003eredistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\n\u003ethat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n\u003e\n\u003eTo believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\n\u003ewrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n\u003e  \n\u003e\nI usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like \nthey're the biggest believers in\nthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the \nrights of that \"proletariat\" you've\njust created with bogus \"law and order\" policies , concentrate capital \nin the hands of a few (ideally people\nwho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, \nand lie - use\nthe word \"compassionate\" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain \namount of poverty reduction actually\nhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the \nRepublic party seems to be the more homeless under\n each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining \nstandards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,\ngreater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the \nwork force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right\n to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining \nstandards of living) is the reality.Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - \nthe CIA world factbook - on the US economy:\"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to \nthe top 20% of households\"Owen\n",

    "email": "new uci dissertation in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : \u003e uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of \u0026p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther \u003e chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : \" partial \" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the \" crossing \" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south \u003e western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani \u003e and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , \u003e kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;

( and bear in mind that you ' ve probably already seen this camera , if you ' ve been doing any comparison shopping . it just had a different name , and cost more . ) http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c the most camera your money can buy . . . sound vision uses new cmos sensor technology at the heart of its svmini - 209 to deliver greatly increased resolution at a lower cost . in fact , sound vision 's cameras were the first on the market to use cmos sensors instead of the traditional ccd sensors used in other digital cameras . the benefits of cmos technology : - higher resolution - - the svmini - 209 captures huge 3 . 2 megapixel images ( that 's 2000x1600 pixels ! ) - lower cost than ccds - - get more camera for the dollar - lower power draw - - dramatically increased battery life knock-out images and accompanying sound can be stored either in camera internal memory or on removable flash memory cards , both linear and sandisk . level - selectable jpeg compression allows you to find the right balance of image quality and memory economy . ( the module which allows the svmini - 209 to use sandisk cards , called the minidisk option , normally is a separate purchase . like we said : we ' re throwing it in for free . that , and a free 2 mb sandisk card - - a combined value of $ 125 ! ) taking great photos with the svmini - 209 is effortless . in addition to the red , green , and blue color receptors common to other digital cameras , the svmini - 209 features a fourth receptor for teal , which dramatically increases possible color depth ( and , in fact , more closely mimics the capabilities of the human retina ) . a sophisticated auto-exposure algorithm prevents the over-saturation of highlights while still preserving shadow detail . an automatic electronic flash guarantees that your shots will be lit to perfection , every time . the experts know . . . byte magazine reviewed the svmini - 209 in its november ' 97 issue , and gave the camera the highest rating , five stars . byte says , \" . . . it delivers ultra-high quality digital images at a relatively bargain price . \" ( the bargain price they ' re talking about is $ 479 . we ' re offering $ 100 + savings over the bargain price . ) to learn more about this outstanding camera , and for a comprehensive discussion of its features , ( and to order ! ) follow the link below : http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c prices for digital cameras span the spectrum . compare its features and benefits with other cameras , and you ' ll find that the svmini - 209 is way more camera for way less cost . compare its features and benefits with the same camera under a popular brand name , and you ' ll find that the svmini - 209 is the identical camera for waaay less cost . thanks for your time ! your friends at skytop sales p . s . digital images have so many fantastic applications : spice up a business proposal or presentation , design a dazzling web site , email photos to friends and family all over the world , create your own photo art using one of the popular graphics programs on the market . the possibilities are endless . . . and with the ultrahigh-quality images of the svmini - 209 in hand , you ' re limited only by your imagination . p . p . s . our agreement with soundvision allows us to sell the svmini - 209 for $ 349 for a limited time only . please act quickly . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - this mailing is intended to be of interest to a large audience and to communicate a valuable offer . if you have no interest in this offer , be advised that other valuable promotions will be featured in future mailings which may be of interest to you . however , if you have no desire to receive offers of value from us in the future , please click the link below to remove yourself from our mailing list . http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rem ? vbanaqeanvsuprqpnpphx copyright 1998 , skytop sales . the information contained in this email message may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or otherwise distributed without the express written consent of skytop sales .",

    "email": "I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums\nfor several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for no\nparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I\nactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n--------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty\nof a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed\nKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000\nfeet. \"It looked like a bison skull,\" the building contractor and\namateur archaeologist recalls. \"I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't\nlive this high up.' \"Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\nbisonâ€“one that died about 340 years ago. \"This was an extraordinary\ndiscovery,\" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. \"There's\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.\"And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\nto Alaskaâ€“a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\nindustryâ€“have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our\npredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\"It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\nstudying these remains,\" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old \"Ice\nMan,\" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\nNatureâ€“and lootersâ€“take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\ndon't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\ndead animal. \"It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,\"\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. \"But when I looked\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.\"Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\nthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\nfrom the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\nfirst place. \"Before this there was no archaeological record of people\nliving here,\" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. \"Now we\nsee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.\"Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\ncaribou dung. \"It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years,\" recalls Kuzyk, then a\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found \"what looked like a\npencil with string wrapped around it.\" It turned out to be a\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\nice patchâ€“and scores of others around the regionâ€“revealed icy layer\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\nyears of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\nsome equipment in the ice. \"We've got people hunting with throwing darts\nup until 1,200 years ago,\" says Hare, who now oversees the research\nproject. \"Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing\ndarts.\"Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell\nand St. Elias mountain rangesâ€“the United States' most glaciated\nterrainâ€“and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\nthe Ice Man. \"Global warming is providing us high-altitude\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're\nprobably about the only ones happy about it.\"\n",

( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a \" blueprint \" of eim major processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics , settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the \" blueprint \" , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems . a complete \" roadmap \" should be laid out with a 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan addresses tactical also . our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries . the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let me know how to proceed . thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers ' conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch . brenda to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect subject : metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals . in particular i promised info on a few areas : project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were : q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less complex than oil \u0026 coal . metals process tends towards buy \u003e store \u003e sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge 2 . inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general . 3 . funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro to the issues faced . 4 . curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6 for the far east ) . the maintaince \u0026 price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote . 5 . re recruitment of paper traders i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced paper . i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london . i ' d appreciate same for eim . regards andy",

    "email": "  | Date: Sat, 20 Jul 2002 10:47:36 +0100\n  | From: Stephen Shirley \n  |[ ... ]\n  | It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second\n  | program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output\n  | of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:\n  | \n  |    mkfifo io\n  |    cmd1  io\n  | \n  | and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking\n  | suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and\n  | can be done using something like:\n  | \n 1|    exec 3\u003e\u00261\n 2|    cmd1 \u003c\u00263 | cmd2 \u003e\u00263\n 3|    exec 3\u003e\u0026-\n  | \n  | but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an\n  | incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions?  [ ... ] the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the\n 1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both\n read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I\n imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work\n but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ). but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:\n  Â· most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);\n and\n  Â· quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout). you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all\n `n\u003e\u0026m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle.  it does not\n change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only\n open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.\n yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2). whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it\n seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes\n is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer\n tty.  that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is\n the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen\n whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor\n confused human luser is \"clearly\" expected to manually echo back\n to the computer what it prints. good luck!  ;-) upshot:  the FIFO is needed.  and this isn't a shell scripting\n          problem per se. the FIFO solution is fine.  I've used variations (plural) on\n this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by\n providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain\n predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over\n to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete\n and `ksh' can resume normal processing.  with some thought and\n care to insure signals do something rational, works great for\n adding a scripting language (which is the purpose) cheaply to\n script-less programs (useful when you can't modify the, IMHO,\n buggy program to use, e.g., TCL).cheers!\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854 9268\n  For a rÃ©sumÃ©, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  Â«Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they\n     don't give a damn about global warming.Â»    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

(It is\namazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for\nUPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and\nits battery supply...)First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was\noccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a\nsequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of\nsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.\nThis one solves the initial problem:--- mh.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002\n+++ mh.tcl\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002\n@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@\n     set seq {}\n     set rseq {}\n     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {\n+\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {\n+\t    # just ignore anything bogus\n+\t    continue;\n+\t}\n \tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]\n \tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {\n \t    lappend seq $parts\nThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring\nbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should\nprobably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\"\nif you like, but I don't think an error is needed).But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,\nby typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,\nI thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\nuser has typed.This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\nis typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special\nuse of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\nrestrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name\nbeginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\ntoggle between typing the current \u0026 target folder name when the name\nbeing typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to\nexist and be typed.Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, 's' is\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\nshow that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \\r instead.\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something\nelse, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\nto bind the same one here.   \\r continues to work of course.And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\nreverted to its usual bindings.In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don't think we really\nneed to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\nfor completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not\nthe previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).kre--- select.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\n+++ select.tcl\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\n     bind $w \t{SelectTypein %W %A}\n     bind $w \t{SelectToggle %W }\n+    bind $w \t{SelectPrev %W }\n     bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W}\n+    bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W %A}\n     bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\n     append select(sel) $a\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\n-\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\n     }\n }\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w +\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\n \tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\n     } else {\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\n     }\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n }\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\n+    global select\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\n+    } else {\n+\tcatch {\n+\t    incr select(sel) -1\n+\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\t}\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n+    }\n+}\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\n \tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\n     }\n }\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$a != {}} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w $a\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tif [info exists select(match)] {\n \t    set select(sel) $select(match)\n \t    unset select(match)\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\n \tunset select(folder)\n     }\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\n     Exmh_Focus\n }\n proc SelectClear { w } {\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",

So for a message I will insert a \n\u003esignature, but for another message I will insert a different signature.\n\u003e\n\u003eIs it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has \nthe ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of \ndifferent sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, \nexmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...\nmenu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed \n.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if \nyou'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows \nfor this).However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into \nthe existing Sedit window prior to composition.I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, \nexmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the \nscript as your signature.I hope this helps some.\n-- Seeya,\nPaul\n--\n\tIt may look like I'm just sitting here doing nothing,\n   but I'm really actively waiting for all my problems to go away.\t If you're not having fun, you're not doing it right!\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",

I select text in the ex\n     mh \n \u003e window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I sel\n     ect \n \u003e it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the \n \u003e recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs \n     and \n \u003e leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no\n      \n \u003e longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection.

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some \ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, \nthe future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry \nthat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems \nmean opportunity. \"Every major industry in the history of \nthe United States has experienced a similar transformation, from \nthe railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s \nto the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert \nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market \nresearch firm. Christopher \nDean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all \nthe people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money \nand for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used \nto cost a few billion for a few millions.\" Read the full \nstory from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end \nof this newsletter. \nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation \nInDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: \nIGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since \nlate May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its \nbusiness plan, we believe this company will help lead the way \nup for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our \nstrongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest \nRating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\nÂ \nGround Floor Opportunity / Tremendous \nGrowth Potential \nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not \ngreater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, \nTalk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share \nprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just \nover $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America \nHoldings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but \ntoday has a market cap of $267 million.\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. \nUsing the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well \nbe trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market \ncap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. \nSo you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right \n for investors to get in on the ground floor.\nÂ \nThe InDigNet Strategy\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company \nthat provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated \ncommunication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious \"Diamond\" \nlevel partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and \nCompaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and \nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the \nCompany to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the \ncapital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s \nstrategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market \ncommunication companies and attractively priced Internet \nService Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed \nits acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. \nInDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow \nrevenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion \nin commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, \nor 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending \nis expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. \nSource: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. \nThe IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com\nÂ \nThe IT Market\nBased on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 \nmillion SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of \nIT and data \ncommunications, including Internet access, web services, business \nsoftware and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 \nbillion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over \n2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher \nIDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, \ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for \nthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in \n2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by \n3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth \nof 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent \nin 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat \ngrowth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will \nreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown \nin China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa \nand Poland. Source: IDC\nÂ \nParticulars\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our \nStrong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following \nreasons:\n1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer \nbases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively \npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell \nits bundled service package to the acquired customer base that \nwill form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all \ntypes of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, \nand data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front \nRange communities but in particular the education vertical market \nhas recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data \nnetwork into the existing campus network. The Company's customers \ninclude United States Olympic Committee \n(USOC), University of Denver, \nand Colorado State University. \n3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues \nto acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy \ncourt and smaller communication providers with valuable customer \nbases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's \nfootprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the \nCompany's embedded customer base. \nÂ \nInvestment Consideration\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the \nthree months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 \nin Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth \nrate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first \nyear of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more \nand more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors \nwill turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment \ndollars. \nÂ \nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

There are alternative fuel sources,\n\u003eincluding seabed methane, biomass and all the usual suspects -- solar,\n\u003ehydro etc. Some of these could be exploited on a decidedly low-tech (ie,\n\u003eemergent civilization) basis. However, it is difficult to conceive of an\n\u003eindustrial civilization that doesn't employ wheels, axles and bearings,\n\u003eall of which require lubrication. I'm not an engineer (Robin, anyone?) but\n\u003eit's my understanding that vegetable lubrication breaks down under stress,\n\u003eand that oil or graphite lubricants are the only reasonable choices for\n\u003ehigh temperature/high rotation applications, at least prior to extremely\n\u003eadvanced modes of chemical synthesis.This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...Robin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire********************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

I signed up for a free accounton some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few links to their book store.This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the next mail is still flagged as spam.Who is losing a trust rating here?

I'm not sure why it is important that the\n \u003e first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any\n \u003e of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,\n \u003e and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the\n \u003e sequences it is looking at, all the time...That was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid\nis that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,\nfor example, or you are selecting a message to display. \u003e It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current\n \u003e folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the\n \u003e directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *\nwill return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.\nBut the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.\nExmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is\nalready pretty tricky \u003e Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\n \u003e context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,\nbut the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\ncheck their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that\nwe checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change\nevery time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about\nthe folder.--\nBrent Welch\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\nPioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\nwww.panasas.com\nwelch@panasas.com\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",

    "email": "PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume.Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear behind the curtain, and all that.However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and Henry \"Dr. Doom\" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might* come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing, key-punching \"administration\" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago, chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what, 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting... A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a pressurized cabin to breathe in.So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for a house, tulips are still nice things to have around.Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you will.So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while there's blood in the streets.As to whether the accounting is \"rigged\", remember what Robert Heinlein said: \"Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you don't play.\"Cheers, RAH The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look behind the curtain, right? :-).- --- begin forwarded text From: Somebody Else To: \"R.

- - - - - - - - - constraint - based theories of phonology have become enormously popular in recent years . such theories express generalizations by stating how and when a language 's phonological forms are constrained , rather than relying on rules that actively modify the forms . computational ideas have often provided an impetus for these innovations . koskenniemi 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduced parallel constraining relations as an alternative to an ordered system of rewrite rules . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focusses on the unity of representations and rules as constraints , drawing on various computational ideas from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculi . one current constraint-based theory is optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince\u0026smolensky 1993 ) . this theory found , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism has been left largely unexplored , ot has proved to be a computationally productive theory , giving rise to several theoretical papers on computational issues related to complexity and learnability , as well as inspiring a number of implementations . this workshop is designed to foster the link between computational work and constraint-based phonology in general . to this end , it invites submissions on topics related to the computation of any constraint-based phonological formalism , including but not limited to the three mentioned above . here are some example topics : * the computational interpretation of phonological theories , * constraint ranking and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementations of particular analyses , * results in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithms for learning constraints or constraint ranking , * results on the learnability of such constraints , * novel formalisms for constraint-based phonology , * representational issues raised by constraint-based approaches . in short , papers are invited which address computational issues in constraint-based theories of phonology . submission -

The code could fall back to\n\u003e the slow-loading pickles, so people running from source still work, just\n\u003e possibly not as well.I haven't used ZODB much really but it sure looks like the Right Way.  I\ndon't think it will fly with the unwashed Unix masses, but it sounds\nlike a piece of cake with the Windows crowd.

    "email": "================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. \nThe truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to \"look before you leap\" then here is your chance.

    "email": "http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB10327475102363433,00.html\nThe Wall Street JournalSeptember 23, 2002\nCOMMENTARYRebuild at Ground ZeroBy LARRY SILVERSTEINEarlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the\nhorrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who\nperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\nand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\namenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\nthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,\nindeed, for all of us.But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\nfeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\nmust be replaced on the site.About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\nalong with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\nTogether, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\neconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\nof the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\nhave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\nYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\nmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\nvibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,\nand there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\nmade a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\nsymbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\ndestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\nwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\nsources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\nall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\nfeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\nsimply never rebuilt.These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\nrecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\nthe towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\noffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\nThat was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\nbefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\nremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\nand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\nplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\neven more the logical locus of office development.And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\nforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\nSecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\nmillion square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\nanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\nheightens the need.As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\ncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\nhistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\noffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\nup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\nat an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\nover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\nline until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\nannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'\nrate.Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\npreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\nextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\nwill most New Yorkers.Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\nthat the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\nfuture.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\nand that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\nsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\nhappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\nresidents of the area.The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm\nwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.-- \n-----------------\nR. A. Hettinga \nThe Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation \n44 Farquhar Street, Boston, MA 02131 USA\n\"... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,\n[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to\nexperience.\" -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'\n",

    "email": "officials study grid ' s close call dave , kim : i think we should reference this article as an example of how price controls degrade reliability . bill , if you have any further insights on what happened that day , let dave perrino or sue mara know . thanks , alan officials study grid ' s close call published friday , aug . 10 , 2001 , in the san jose mercury news by steve johnson , john woolfolk and glennda chui mercury news two energy agencies announced thursday that they are investigating charges some california generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity , and atlanta - based mirant admitted it had a role in last week ' s incident that briefly imperiled the western power grid . california officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on aug . 2 and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse , threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to 65 million people . but it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again . some generators and a federal official questioned the california independent system operator ' s handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified . but stephanie mccorkle with the california agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didn ' t follow orders . and she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity . ` ` we asked them over and over why they ' re not following our dispatch instructions , ' ' she said , adding that some have provided ` ` explanations that don ' t add up . it makes us suspicious . ' ' mccorkle said the aug . 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power . that left the western grid - - a vast network of high - voltage lines , transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of canada and mexico - - with a sudden and severe electrical shortage . if uncorrected , she and others said , it could have led to widespread power outages . although officials need to keep the grid ' s electrical frequency at 60 hertz , the aug . 2 shortage lowered it to 59 . 93 hertz . state officials said blackouts could occur at 59 . 65 hertz . mccorkle declined to name the companies involved . but patrick dorinson , a spokesman for mirant , which has three plants in the bay area , said it was partly responsible . while offering few details about what happened , he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ` ` not making a timely call ' ' and ` ` some software problems with our computers . ' ' ` ` it happens , ' ' dorinson said . ` ` people make mistakes . ' ' an official with the federal energy regulatory commission , one of the agencies investigating the matter , said it views the aug . 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesn ' t happen again . the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order . but at this point , the official said , it ' s unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion , incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices . the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didn ' t declare a statewide emergency on aug . 2 when the promised electricity wasn ' t delivered . had it done so , he said , the agency would have had more leverage over the generators . some power company representatives complained that the iso doesn ' t always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs . for many plants , ` ` it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up , ' ' said richard wheatley , a spokesman with reliant energy of houston . ` ` you physically can ' t do it . ' ' but iso officials defended their procedures , and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug . 2 wouldn ' t have been feasible . ` ` this was so quick , ' ' he said . ` ` it was less than half an hour total from start to finish , and we were able to deal with it appropriately ' ' without suffering blackouts . the incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council , a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials , which sets rules for managing grids in the region ' s nearly 1 . 8 million square miles . robert dintelman , the agency ' s assistant executive director , said brief electricity fluctuations , such as the one that hit california or worse , occur once or twice a month across the west . on aug . 1 , for example , the frequency dipped to 59 . 75 in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there , dintelman said . but he said california ' s claim that generators aren ' t following orders is unusual . ` ` that is alarming , ' ' he added . the council can issue fines for some rule violations . but dintelman said he ' s not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power . nationally , such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak , said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council . her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher , but the legislation has stalled . meanwhile , she said , grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide . although the motivation for these incidents varies , she said , sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves , ` ` even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk .

Make more in a few months than last year at work. \nBelieve it, work it. \nThis really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this \n4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders \n(money) \nstarted coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a \ntry!! \nYou will be glad you did. \nThanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't \ndelete this!!! \n------------------------------------------------------ \nFirst read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... \nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. \nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN \nIN HIS CLOSET! \nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. \nYou most likely have just seen this story recently \nfeatured on a major nightly news program (USA). \nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning \nand putting laundry away when she came across a large \nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath \nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her \n15-year-old sons closet. \nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got \nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. \nFive-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - \nall neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. \n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", \nsays the 41-year-old woman, \"There was over $71,000 \ndollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband \nearns in a year\". \nThe woman immediately called her husband at the \ncar-dealership where he worked to tell him what she \nhad discovered. He came home right away and they \ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up. \nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from \nwas more shocking than actually finding it in \nthe closet. \nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via \nE-mail, a type of \"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he \nobtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for \nthe past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his \ncomputer in his bedroom. \n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the \nheck, I put my name on it like the instructions said \nand I started sending it out\", says the clever \n15-year-old. \nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained \ninstructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person \non the list, then delete the address at the top and \nmove the others addresses down, and finally to add \nyour name to the top of the list. \nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive \nseveral thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 \nweeks if you sent out the letter with your \nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk \nE-mail all the time, and really did not think it was \ngoing to work\", the boy continues. \nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, \nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him \nfor his video-game magazine subscriptions began to \nfill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing \n$5 bills. \n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post \noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 \nenvelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip \nthat said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. \nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)\". He \ngoes on, \"I went up to the counter and they had a \nwhole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back \nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not \ncarry it all\". \nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending \nout the E-mail. \"The money just kept coming in and I \njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, \nbarely had time for my homework\". He had also \nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his \narea and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties \nand hundreds. \n\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept \nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a \ntime in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at \nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to \nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. \nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and \ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and \nmy dad would have to come in and do it, but I just \nrode to the next bank down the street (laughs).\" \nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be \nafraid. The reporting news team examined and \ninvestigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was \nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter \nat all. In fact, it was completely legal according to \nUS Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and \n1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also \nin the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, \nSections 255 and 436, which state a product or service \nmust be exchanged for money received. \nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a \nlittle note that read, \"Please send me report number \nXYX\".This simple note made the letter legal because he \nwas exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee. \n[This is the end of the media release. If you would \nlike to understand how the system works and get your \n$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below \nis what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - \nYOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple \ninstructions]. \nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! \n================================================== \nYou will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your \nhome!! \nBefore you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the \nletter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the \npopularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news \nprogram \nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program \ndescribed below, to see if it really can make people money. The show \nalso \ninvestigated whether or not the program was legal. \nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO \nLaws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow \nthe simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \n$25 out of pocket cost''. \nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY \u0026 RESPECT THIS \nPROGRAM HAS \nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \nThis is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. \nI was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so \nglad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for \nthe minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received \ntotal \n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. \nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \n=========================================================\n=======Here is \nanother testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a \nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this \nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the \nsimple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to \ncome \nin. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that \nmade a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering \nthe \nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \nanything.'' More testimonials later but first: \n===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$ \nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily \nand comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and \nAGAIN!!! \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$ \nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL \nDREAMS WILL COME \nTRUE, GUARANTEED! \nINSTRUCTIONS: \n================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \n================= \nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME \u0026 NUMBER OF THE REPORT \nYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose \nname appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN \nADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail \nproblems. \n=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 \nreports. \nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer \nand resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. \nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports \nfrom these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will \nbe accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them \nfrom you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk \nin case something happens to your computer. \nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed \nnext to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other \nthan what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will \nloose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this \nworks, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, \nthis \nmethod has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People \nhave tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they \ncould get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all \nhave tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change \nanything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not \nwork for you. \nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \n1....

Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. \n5.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 \n6.... Insert YOUR name \u0026 address in the REPORT # 1 Position. \nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name \u0026 address ACCURATELY! \n=========================================================\n======= \n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it \non your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. \nSave this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist \nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you \npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which \nincludes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of \nfree \nclassified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this \nventure going: \nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n=========================================================\n======= \nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. \nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the \nresponse \ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many \npeople will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 \neach).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. \nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 \nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total \nof 50,000. \nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 \npeople responded and ordered Report # 2. \nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 \ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 \nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders \nfor Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a \ntotal of \n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 \norders for \nReport # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \nmillion). \nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \n+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand \nTotal=$555,550.00 \nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL \u0026 PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE \nWORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL \nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! \n=========================================================\n======= \nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING \nOUT \nOF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if \neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails \neach or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide \nand counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! \nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n=========================================================\n======= \nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are \nhundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the \nInternet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you \nstart with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you \nreceive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's \nit. Always provide \nsame day service on all orders. \nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your \nname and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise \nuntil they receive the report. \n===================AVAILABLE REPORTS \n========================== \nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER \u0026 NAME ONLY. Notes: Always \nsend \n$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure \nthe cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On \none of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER \u0026 the NAME of the Report you \nare ordering, \nYOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. \nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \n=========================================================\n======= \nREPORT #1 \"The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\" \nOrder Report #1 from: \nK.Palludan \n9550 Summersweet Ct. \nLas Vegas, Nevada 89123 \nUSA \n________________________________________________________________\n______ \nREPORT #2 \"'The insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net' \nOrder Report #2 from: \nKris Estes \n3055 Casey Drive #203 \nLas Vegas, Nevada 89120 \n________________________________________________________________\n______ \nREPORT #3 \"'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net\" \nOrder Report #3 from : \nP. Clement \n601 St-Malo Est \nIle Bizard, Quebec H9C2P2 \nCANADA \n________________________________________________________________\n______ \nREPORT #4 \"'How to become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM and the Net\" \nOrder Report #4 from: \nDavid Carpenter \n13 Dutch lane \nHazlet, New Jersey 07732 \nUSA \n________________________________________________________________\n_____ \nREPORT #5 \"'How to send out one Million e-mails for FREE\" \nOrder Report #5 from: \nS. Lasley \n4230 Edgewood Circle \nIdaho Falls, Idaho 83406 \nUSA \n________________________________________________________________\n_____ \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success: \n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 \nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. \n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you \nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue \nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do. \n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN \nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will \ncontinue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your \nname \nis moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. \nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \npeople are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME \nSEND \nANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS \nAGAIN. There is NO \nLIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! \n=========================================================\n======= \nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \nYou have just received information that can give you financial freedom \nfor the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. \nYou can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have \never imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change \nit \nin \nany way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. \nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put \nyour name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 \nas \ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out \n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. \nRemember \nthough, the more you send out the more potential customers! you will \nreach. So \nmy friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and \nopportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! \n====================== MORE \nTESTIMONIALS====================== \n'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of \nthe population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody \ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in \nwith \nboth feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was \non me! \nWithin 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she \nhad \nreceived total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have \njoined \nJody in her ''hobby''. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois \n=========================================================\n======= '' Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my \nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided \nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that \nI \nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was \nsurprised \nwhen I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made \n$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is \nthat it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better \ninvestment \nwith a faster return and so big''. \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n=========================================================\n======= '' I had \nreceived this program before. I deleted it, but later I \nwondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who \nto contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed \nagain by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came \nagain.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my \nfirst try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \n=========================================================\n====== \n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and \nwithin 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made \n$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ \n362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''. \nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand \n=========================================================\n=======ORDER \nYOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO \nFINANCIAL FREEDOM ! \n=========================================================\n======= \nIf you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the \nOffice of Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade \nCommission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C. \n=========================================================\n======= \nTHERE IS NO NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS E-MAIL IF YOU DO NOT \nWISH TO RECEIVE \nFURTHER CORRESPONDENCE.

the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 -

drop analysis of rizzi ( 1994 ) . we argue contra sano \u0026 hyams ( 1994 ) that these missing subjects are instances of pro , not pro , and demonstrate that the economy-based pro-drop theory of speas ( 1994 ) handles our data in an elegant fashion . the analysis we propose links the acquisition of subjects to the acquisition of functional morphology , in accordance with the minimalist program developed since chomsky ( 1989 ) . one desirable consequence of the approach taken here is that no recourse to a pro-drop parameter is necessary . ircs-94 -

louise kitchen no . 17 fortune , 10 / 15 / 01 drop in natural - gas prices may be good for consumers but hinder new production by alexei barrionuevo staff reporter of the wall street journal 10 / 02 / 2001 the wall street journal c 7 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones \u0026 company , inc . ) in the wake of last month ' s terrorist attacks , natural - gas prices have slid below $ 2 per million british thermal units , frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural - gas projects . analysts predict that with prices at current levels , projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u . s . could be shelved or canceled . natural - gas prices , which reached highs of nearly $ 10 per million btus last december , had held to around $ 3 to $ 5 per million btus for much of the year . at $ 2 per million btus and below , producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production . analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand , fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric - utility demand . nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $ 2 . 208 on the new york mercantile exchange . in the boston area , however , different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region . last week , the u . s . coast guard , under pressure from local lawmakers , indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor . lng makes up 15 % of new england ' s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days . the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists . already , relative to other areas , natural - gas prices have inched higher in new england , where natural - gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market . the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to $ 1 . 30 per million btus , said a spokeswoman for distrigas , a unit of belgium ' s tractebel sa . but the lack of lng isn ' t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural - gas storage is used up . richard grant , ceo of distrigas , says lng has a 30 - year safety record at the company ' s everett , mass . , terminal . while lng is flammable , he says it is unlikely to explode . he adds that \" there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual . but until we answer the concerns , we won ' t be able to bring a ship in here . \" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . \" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , \" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . \" but all that is out the window now . \" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . \" you will see some cancellations and some delays , \" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james \u0026 associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones \u0026 company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman \u0026 wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . \" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , \" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in \" patient but not passive , \" the story that accompanies the list , \" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . \" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , \" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , \" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah \" hurricane debby \" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president \u0026 ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond -

where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . \" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , \" it took a lady to save avon , \" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , \" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos -

Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was\nthe Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your\nsoftware--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for\nfree. Now, even Yahoo is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client.\nBut if you look closely enough, you can still find some\nworthwhile free apps. We've reviewed four free e-mailers to get you started. And we've also\ntaken a peek at the new BearShare, which is not only\nfree itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no\ncost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is\nanother matter entirely.

So-called\n   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as\n   before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another\n   look at so-called \"free\" e-mailers.\n   Get the gear you need to burn DVDs\nDVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but\n   picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task.\n   We've broken down the process and selected the best gear\n   for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player.\n   \nBearShare 4.0\nThe latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client\n   lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a\n   nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus,\n   BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware\n   when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear\n   to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why.Read the reviewÂ |Â Manufacturer priceYahoo MailÂ  \nAfter months of beta testing and pricing adjustments (that's right, Yahoo now charges for some services), the new Yahoo Mail just hit the Web.

SBC Yahoo Dial\n \n Thanks to a partnership with SBC Pacific Bell, Yahoo is now\n   in the dial-up game. The new service, known as SBC Yahoo\n   Dial, offers a customized browser, 25MB of storage, and 11\n   e-mail addresses--all for $21.95 or lower, depending on\n   your SBC service package.

Everytime I try to download files\n   \u003efrom the Internet, QuickTime tries to upgrade, stopping the\n   \u003edownload cold. I tried to remove the software, but it won't\n   \u003elet me. Can you help? I would like to use Windows Media\n   \u003ePlayer instead. --Wicked\n   \n Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops\n   up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s)\n   from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have\n   QuickTime set as your default media player for all media\n   files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date,\n   whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply\n   upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade\n   feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit \u003e\n   Preferences \u003e QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled\n   \"Check for updates automatically.\"\n\t   \n   If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player,\n   open that program, click Tools \u003e Options. Select the Formats\n   tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that\n   you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that\n   QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those\n   file types within QuickTime.\nCNET reviews QuickTime 5.0\nCNET reviews Windows Media Player 7.1\nE-mail your stories and questions to: software-mailbag@cnet.com.Live tech help: submit your questions now\nCNET News.com: Top CIOs on the future of IT\nFind a job you love, with more than 1 million postings\nZDNet: This IT director has had enough of Microsoft\nMay Editors' Choice award: Pioneer's HTS-910DV\nÂ \nSearchÂ Â In SoftwareAll CNETÂ Â Â Â The Web\nÂ Â \n        The e-mail address for your subscription isÂ qqqqqqqqqq-cnet-newsletters@spamassassin.taint.org\nUnsubscribeÂ |\nÂ Manage My Subscriptions\nÂ |Â FAQÂ |\nÂ AdvertisePrice comparisons |\nProduct reviews |\nTech news |\nDownloads |\nAll CNET services        Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

( press release 10 / 11 / 2004 businesswire ) thats 4 vessels already , and more news is likely to be released in the coming weeks . all this sets the stage for a move onto otcbbwhich is precisely where company chairman and ceo , will riner , sr . , is ready to take isyj . from there , the breakout could unfold at a skyrocketing pace ! a $ 1 share price by july 2005 ? invest in isyj now , youll be in at around . 20 a share , just preceding the time when next yearsinvestors could be clamoring for shares at $ 1 or more ! t he independent investment advisor the research works projected isyj to trade at $ 1 . 05 by july 2005 . from their report : management has suggested that the silversea contract is the company ' s model for the future . as in - systcom negotiates with other cruise lines representing 40 ships and 32 , 000 cabins , the company expects to gross approximately $ 15 weekly per cabin in revenue as it expands . expanding on those revenue figures yields stunning numbers . in north america alone , 215 , 000 cruise ship cabins ( berths ) represents a total potential market for isyj of $ 167 . 7 million a year ! in - systcoms very reasonable growth strategy , which has been updated to 50 ships over 18 to 24 months , projects to revenues of $ 31 . 2 million a year in 2006 ! and at the current netprofitability of around 31 % of gross revenue , that projects to about 17 eps ! with aggressive growth companies typically trading at 30 to 40 times earnings , isyj could reasonably be a $ 6 to $ 7 stock in 24 months ! longer term , perhaps 24 to 36 months , isyj has all the potential to be a $ 7 to $ 10 stockthats 2 , 800 % to 4 , 000 % growth from todays share price offering investors right now the potential to start small with minimal risk and hit the jackpot ! just $ 2 , 000 invested today could return $ 54 , 000 to $ 78 , 000 in pure profit ! this is the kind of opportunity that could make your dreams come true . and the best part is , the technology is already installed and serving thousands of passengers right now . its just waiting to grow as more and more ships are outfitted with the in - systcom sealynx system ! on the current installation schedule , isyj profits could be com ing on fast . according to projections provided by ceo , wil riner , in - systcom could reach first profitability as early as 2 nd quarter 2005 ! companies on the pink sheets fantasize about the day when they may see revenues , let alone those that turn a profit ! yet in - systcom is projecting profits just a few months from now ! whats more , the current installations are working as planned and revenues are beginning to flow that make profits in q 2 / 05 a very real probability . thus , this is one of those pivotal moments in a companys life that marks a turning point for investors . do you invest nowor do you wait and miss the explosive price surge coming out of pink sheet valuations ? if youre an aggressive investor , the answer should be clear . at todays share price , this could be one of the very best investment decisions you make . even if you limited yourself to just a few thousand shares , you could turn a handsome profit in just a few months , with a very modest downside risk . whats more , by buying now , youll be setting the stage for a major breakout in the future and a fat profit to pad your position ! not a pipe dream . not an rd promise . its real , onboard , and happening now ! since the in - systcom is already operational on a number of ships , serving tens of thousands of passengers , you dont have to wait for the sales department to prove that theres a market either ! new orders should be coming in very quickly . especially as cruise lines see the capabilities of their competitors grow . rather than looking for customers , in - systcom could be faced with the enviable problem of having them line up at the door ! competition ? not any time soon ! this is a fantasy island of profit opportunity ! youll love this part of the show right now , theres no competition to the in - systcom technology ! its the only show in town ! if a cruise line wants internet connections to the cabins , it has two choices . dry dock and retrofit , or choose in - systcom to interface with their existing systems . the growing market and only one source for a sensible solution ! according to more cruise industry statistics , about 87 % ( 8 . 3 million passengers ) of cruise ship passengers boarded north american cruise ships . you know what that means , a whole city full of americans with no personal access to the internet , even for e - mail ! these are people who write big checks for first class service . its reasonable to think that the vast majority of them live by e - mail at home and at work . and since most cruises last more than a week , internet access could be a make - or - break point about booking a cruise . whats more , the problem is getting worse . since the year 2000 , the cruise industr y has grown from 5 . 1 million passengers to 9 . 5 million . by 2010 , the figures are expected to soar past 17 million passengers ! and youre going to deny these people access to the internet ? since most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not anticipate a modern internet , the cruise operators have had nothing to offer except on - board public internet lounges . that just doesnt cut it in 2005 ! the in - systcom solution puts the internet into every cabin on board ! live sports shows and movies too ! from marketing perspective , this could be the right product at the right time for a growing industry . once a cruise company makes the commitment to upgrade to in - cabin internet , e - mail and interactive services , in - systcom can have a fully operational system up and running in a matter of weeks , with no downtime and no disruption to normal cruise activities . in - systcoms technology breakthrough came when it developed an interface that linked the existing phone wiring with the ships c - band or k - band com links . these com links provide the uplink and downlink needed to enable internet and satellite tv access while the in - systcom sealynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the room - to - room wiring network . as reported by in - systcom management , nobody else has this technology nor anything like it . whats more , in - systcom is not just targeting the cruise ship industry ! the resorts at cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas . high - end resorts on remote is lands face similar challenges providing guests with access to online entertainment , movies and sports programming that their american guests have come to expect . using in - systcom technology , resorts could soon offer a complete menu of in - room entertainment , including internet access and e - mail . that market adds millions more travelers to in - systcoms potential revenue equation . invest now in isyj and you could sit back and relax on a profit - making cruise of a lifetime . and , you can expect your investment will be well managed because even though in - systcom is a relatively new company in - systcom is commanded by a seasoned crew of technology and cruise industry veterans . with veterans like this at the helm , you can be certain your investment will stay true to an aggressive growth course . wil riner , sr . , chairman / ceo / director , has more than 30 years of experience , both domestic and international , in marketing , product development and telecommunications . in 1983 , he received a u . s . patent for the first integrated personal computer workstation featuring a multi - line business phone and multi - tasking capability . in 1986 , mr . riner founded the network connection inc . ( nasdaq : tncx ) , a designer of computer servers and interactive , broadband information and entertainment systems . in 1999 , he helped orchestrate the companys merger with in - flight technologies , then moved on to create in - syst . com inc . , in january 2000 . peter demilio , president , is a former manager of marine technologies for carnival cruise lines , where he m anaged the development and installation of interactive television systems , internet cafes , advanced broadcast television , and satellite telecommunications services . he also owned a technology company devoted to computer graphics , video presentation , and interactive communications . hes also a member of the federal communications advisory committee on the future of interactive telecommunication technology within the maritime industry . wil riner , jr . , vp engineering / director is the former director of sales and marketing of tnci atlanta where he developed domestic and international distribution of the company ' s lines of video server products used in training and entertainment . in 1998 , tnci became the first company ever to install an faa certified digital seat back entertainment system aboard a commercial aircraft . mr . riners other project includes th e sale of shipboard in - cabin digital entertainment system for carnival ' s 900 cabin sensation and carnivals 1200 cabin flag ship triumph ! . stephen stethers , vice president / secretary and a director has more than 15 years experience in the personal computer and network server industries . he is the former vp of operations and project manager for the network connection inc . ( tncx ) , responsible for overall project management and installation of the cruiseview video on demand system isolating dedicated channels for in - house services . mr . stethers has completed projects aboard two cruise ships ( star cruises , malaysia ; carnival cruises , florida ) . what you should do now to lock in this opportunity . at the time of thi s writing , isyj has been trading at $ 0 . 20 per share , so this is the ideal opportunity to lock in a solid position with a small investment . because of isyjs aggressive growth plan is progressing now , you could see rapid share price gains in the coming weeks as news of isyjs accomplishments is announced and investor interest grows . it is reasonable that the current share price represents the very best entry point for new inv estors . however , as can be expected , this is a risky investment suitable only for aggressive investors willing to assume the risk of substantial losses . considering the current state of isyjs growing business and very low price per share , a significant position in the company can be taken n ow putting just a modest investment at risk . 400 % near - term share price growth projectioncompany : in - systcom , inc . ticker : isyj ! near - term projection : $ 0 . 80 $ 1 . 00 growth : 400 % / 6 months 2 , 800 % + / 12 - 24 months * * analysis provided in this report . watch for news due out very soon that could send share prices up in a sharp immediate spike of 30 % to 50 % ! view or chang e your preferences legal disclosure",

( nyse : ene ) stock sustained further heavy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years . the energy giant ' s stock was off $ 3 . 32 or 11 . 45 percent at $ 25 . 68 per share at mid - day trade on oct . 19 , making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million . as of early morning trading on oct . 22 , enron shares were priced at $ 21 . 99 , a reflection of new developments ( including a new securities and exchange inquiry ) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors . analysis : enron ' s first financial report since the departure of former ceo jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company , which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory . while skilling cited personal reasons for his departure , many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron ' s share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role . at the time of skilling ' s departure , enron ' s stock had tumbled to a 52 - week low . however , based on the new 3 q report , it now appears that enron ' s downward turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company ' s top spot . in essence , enron ' s financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales . it appears that enron is learning a costly lesson - namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company ' s innovation , especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised . the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron , as a good number of unresolved issues and a new securities and exchange commission ( sec ) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company . let ' s first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the third quarter . as noted , as a whole the company reported $ 638 million in losses , after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges associated with several of its non - core businesses . when we break down the losses , it becomes clear that enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses : water , broadband and the retail power market . specifically , enron reported $ 287 million in charges from azurix , its water and wastewater business ; $ 180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations ( including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts ) ; and $ 544 million in what the company is calling \" investment losses . \" evidently , about half of the $ 544 - million figure is related to enron ' s investment in newpower company , the retail electricity and natural - gas provider that enron launched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm . enron owns 45 percent of newpower . in addition , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent , although lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002 . however , it is important to note that enron ' s 3 q recurring net income ( before the write - offs ) did increase 35 percent to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a diluted share , and revenue in the quarter rose to $ 47 . 6 billion from $ 30 billion in 3 q 2000 . the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting . as one of the leading investors in the company , enron drove newpower ' s aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales , despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the united states . newpower went public last year at an opening price of $ 21 , and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price . however , the company ' s stock has experienced a devastating drop in value , and is currently priced at $ 1 . 25 . newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3 q financial statement until early november , but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future . specifically , newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3 q loss of $ 65 million to $ 70 million , or $ 1 . 12 to $ 1 . 20 a share . third - quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $ 60 million to $ 65 million that the company had forecast in august . in analyzing newpower ' s 2 q financial losses ( see issuealert from 8 / 8 / 01 at www . scientech . com / rci ) , i argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the united states . on the positive side , newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from aes corp . and dte energy . these purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for newpower , and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states . however , the bad news for newpower is that its losses continue to widen , apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates . this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better , and the company ' s stock has continued to drop as a result . in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes , newpower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp . and several of its subsidiaries . the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries through jan . 4 , 2002 . with the lowered financial obligations that it must make to enron , newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset - based financing . however , from enron ' s perspective , the losses associated with newpower ( and , by the same token , the losses in water and broadband ) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price . the message is clear : the businesses that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole . further , what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron ' s part has not translated into measurable profits , and consequently wall street has reacted by sending enron ' s stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago . the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all unique , but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from what was a successful core business . further , they are similar in that enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth . the problem with enron ' s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber - optic lines , which has prevented the demand for the division ' s services from materializing as anticipated . the problem with azurix , which has been losing money since its formation in 1998 , is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies anticipated . in addition to these problem areas , enron also faces challenges related to its investments in india ( where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government ) and california ( from which enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales ) . in addition to the losses outlined in the 3 q report , there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week . first , the sec has requested that enron provide information regarding \" certain related party transactions . \" not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry . however , it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of enron ' s chief financial officer andrew fastow , who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from enron . ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec ' s request . in a separate development , several mutual funds ( including aim constellation that once held large positions in enron ) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company , which has further weakened enron ' s stock value . portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about enron ' s ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader . the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses . thus , lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company ' s energy and gas - pipeline business are still strong . further , lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to \" clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses . \" nevertheless , the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort , and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well . thus , several questions remain at this juncture . are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading ? or , will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002 ? moving forward , will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably ? only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at enron , which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change . an archive list of previous issuealerts is available at www . scientech . com we encourage our readers to contact us with their comments . we look forward to hearing from you . nancy spring reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day . your company can schedule a sponsorship of issuealert by contacting jane pelz . advertising opportunities are also available on our website . our staff is comprised of leading energy experts with diverse backgrounds in utility generation , transmission \u0026 distribution , retail markets , new technologies , i / t , renewable energy , regulatory affairs , community relations and international issues . contact consulting @ scientech . com or call nancy spring at 1 -

    "email": "re : 6 . 775 , syldavian tutorial there is one ( at least ) translation of the oldest syldavian text , which our first tutorial ommitted . ihave waited to long to refer interested readers to my sources , but it is an inevitable work for those interested as much in syldavian as in bordurian . it comes from frederic soumois ' dossier tintin : sources , versions , themes , structures , jacques antoine , 1987 . it shows how much herge used brussels french and flemish roots in every language he \" devised \" in his works . for example , pace guy who adopted herge 's own suggestion of translation of \" eih bennek , eih blavek \" by \" qui s ' y frotte s ' y pique \" ( roughly , \" whoever rubs himself against it will get stung by it \" ) , it looks more like dutch \" hier ben ik , hier blijf ik \" , meaning \" here i am , here i stay \" . the translation soumois proposes for the xivth century manuscript goes approximately like this ( i won't bother to go into the etymological details , and i won [ t try to reproduce the original text : \" father ottokar , thou art then king of [ the city / poland ? ] , then the trone is for me \" . that one says to the other : \" come get the sceptre \" . and the king stroke staszrvich with the sceptre , and the nanny-goat [ ? ] fell on the floor / was left on the field . \" i also recommend , as an example of l2 morphology , the excellent passage in borduria that one can find in the french version of \" the calculus affair \" ( l ' affaire tournesol ) , unfortunately absent in the english version , and hopefully to be found again in the german version , if i can get it ( and probably not in the chinese version ) . there are also short passages of linguistic interest in destination moon and explorers on the moon , and , for arumbaya , in tintin and the broken ear . any useful or absolutely useless information welcome . richard desrochers",
