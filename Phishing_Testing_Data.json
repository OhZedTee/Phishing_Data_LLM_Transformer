    "email": "Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive\n \n by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in\n Antarctica has been found alive in a \"big huddle\".  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New\n Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \n \n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\n successful breeding season over the winter.\" \n \n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\n station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the\n cape, may have lost up to third of its population. \n------------------------ Yahoo!
