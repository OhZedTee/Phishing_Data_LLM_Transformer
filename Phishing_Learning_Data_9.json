u = 5526 \u0026 m = 1402 , alternative url : warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing sense that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and steep decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the mid - $ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual fuel oil in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera \u0001 , s view adequate supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a quick return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap . storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october 20 accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift in market psychology . last week \u0001 , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately 3 . 8 bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58 bcf above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october 22 . with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures expected next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table 1 ) . is this inventory level \" enough \" ? not yet . storage inventories this winter under 15 - year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf above the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total withdrawals in the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above last year \u0001 , s withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face of a return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this winter , holding withdrawals down requires both of the following : * industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down . these markets represent approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return , should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol . * the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas . in cera \u0001 , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis , particularly as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter demand can be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can be held reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march 1996 and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average of $ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was nearly 4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was lower , and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas customers in the united states . market fundamentals in cera \u0001 , s view still support gas prices above those of resid , which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm weather throughout november and into december could reverse this relationship , but a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the market . cera \u0001 , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - - stands for now . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated table . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

    "email": "review : cook : case grammar applied walter a . cook . s . j . ( 1998 ) \" case grammar applied \" a publication of the summer institute of linguistics and the university of texas at arlington , 1998 , 271 pages reviewed by tania avgustinova , university of saarland . synopsis the book is intended as a companion volume to \" case grammar theory \" ( 1989 ) by the same author , and is devoted to the application of the model developed in this earlier publication to english text analysis . this in particular means that the main stress of the present work is on methodological issues , which are presented on an extended textual analysis of hamingway 's \" the old man and the sea \" . the actual goal of the discussed monograph is twofold : for the grammar - to present a method for sentence semantics which describes the meaning underlying each simple sentence ; for the lexicon - to present a method for further defining each sense of each verb / predicate in terms of semantic classes ( case-frame - based typology ) . each clause in its underlying structure is reduced to a kernel sentence which is defined as a simple complete active-voice affirmative statement . all texts are reduced to a sequence of kernel sentences the model used is the case grammar matrix model . it presents a clear predicate-argument structure , builds a lexicon which distinguishes various verb senses , and not only describes arguments occurring in the text , but through covert roles , describes implicit arguments . this model is supplemented by the use of conceptual graphs , following sowa ( 1984 ) . each verb type has a generalised conceptual graph to indicate the predicate-argument structure ; and each example in the text contains the canonical graph of that sentence using the verb and nouns as concepts , and case labels as the verb-to - noun relations . the book is organised in the following way . chapter 1 ( pp . 1-54 ) presents the case grammar matrix model in summary form and introduces conceptual graph representation . the next four chapters treat verbs / predicates in four distinguished semantic domains . chapter 2 ( pp . 55-90 ) deals with the basic domain that includes all state , process , and action verbs which use only the agent and object cases . chapter 3 ( pp . 91-126 ) deals with the experiential domain , the domain of sensation , emotion , cognition , and communication . it involves state , process , and action verbs which include an experiencer case in their descriptions . chapter 4 ( pp . 127-42 ) deals with the benefactive domain , the domain of possession and transfer of property , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a benefactive case . chapter 5 ( pp . 143-82 ) deals with the locative domain , the domain of physical location and movement , and describes state , process , and action verbs that include a locative case . chapter 6 ( pp . 182-220 ) deals with other elements involved in the logical representation of sentences , including tense , aspect , modals , performatives , and negatives , showing how these elements may be included in the logical structure , and ending with a sample sentence parse using case grammar . chapter 7 ( pp . 221-46 ) summarises the analysis of more than 500 examples in chapters 2 through 5 and demonstrates the verbal hierarchy expressed by the twelve cells of the case grammar matrix , organised by verbal domain , verb type , and argument structure . each of the verb types is described together with its conceptual graph , its frequency of occurrence , its subtype , and its defining characteristics . the appendix to the text contains an alphabetical lexicon , listing all of the verbs / predicates in the examples together with their case frames ( pp . 247-52 ) , and a case lexicon , with the verbs sorted by case frame together with references for each verb to the pages where the use of the verb is exemplified ( pp . 253-60 ) . finally , there is a list of references ( pp . 261 - 6 ) , and an index ( pp . 267-71 ) . critical evaluation case grammar ( cg ) works with labelled predicate-argument structure , and thus , in its core , belongs to the dependency grammar paradigm . cg develops a semantic valence system that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a central predicate ( usually and typically a lexical verb , but also a predicate adjective , a predicate noun , or a predicate adverb ) and a series of case-labelled arguments ( nominal , adverbial ) required by the meaning of that predicate . so , the type of case considered in the book is ' governed case ' , and in fact , nothing is said about the way cg model would treat ' concordial case ' - cf . , e . g . , blake ( 1994 ) for a detailed discussion of these notions . there is no case concord in english and , hence , the challenges posited by ' concordial case ' are trivially out of the scope of the presented analysis ( which is based exclusively on english data ) . the ambition of the proponents of cg is to develop a semantic interpretation system that is universal across languages , and not tied to the syntax of any particular sentence . on the basis of the presented extensive data analysis it is claimed that the five case labels used in the work ( i . e . agent , object , experiencer , benefactive , and locative ) are necessary and sufficient for the description of all the verbs / predicates in the language ( in this case english ) . the possibility of creating different lists of cases is left open , whereby full translatability is theoretically expected between any consistent list of cases and the one employed in the cg matrix model . both the predicate and its arguments are viewed as concepts ( i . e . the conceptual universe is made up of verbs which describe states or events , and nouns which describe things ) , while the case role labels indicate relations ( which arguments bear to their predicates ) . cg is written in conceptual graph format by placing the concepts ( predicates , arguments ) in boxes and relations ( case roles ) in circles . the arrows in the notation point away from the predicate which is the source of the case relations . an advantage of such an approach is the possibility of defining the default position of the lexical predicate in its case frame , i . e . with respect to the arguments it governs . in the discussed book , a fairly credible ontology of predicators is achieved by hierarchically sorting them according to domain as basic , experiential , benefactive , locative , ( and possibly ) time , and within each domain as state , process , action . further sub-classification of the predicates is based on the number or the position of the arguments . the resulting hierarchical taxonomy is similar to a thesaurus in which all entities are organised into semantic domains . the organisation of the semantic domains is worked out in detail and with precision . the question of case inventory is central to cg , as well as to any theory working with the notion of case . also methodologically , a clear distinction must be made between essential cases , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , and modal case , which are mainly adverbial adjuncts . only essential cases can be used for describing predicates . despite of the lack of universal agreement on the number of case role labels or the way in which they are defined , the author gives a clear step-by step method , accompanied by various concrete tests , how to simplify in practice the case assignment . thus , the labelling is deferred until three basic questions are answered : how many arguments are required by the verb ? what verb type - state , process , or action - is in the structure ? to what semantic domain does the verb belong ? then , the naming of the arguments can be simplified by a set of principles , in combination with a set of tactics for the formation of case frames . within case frames , cases are listed left-to - right according to a subject choice hierarchy ( agent - experiencer - benefactive - object - locative ) which is merely a generalisation covering the unmarked choice . marked choices which violate the subject choice hierarchy are indicated in the lexicon by changing the order of cases in the case frame . possible variations involve \" equatives \" ( in copular constructions ) , regarded in this model as double - object frames in the basic domain , and rank shifts in the subject choice hierarchy . in the lexicon , predicators are classified according to case frames . the case frame is understood as a configuration of one to three cases that are required by the meaning of the verb ( or more generally , the predicate ) . let us remind , however , that , in lexical semantics research , cases are known where the frame would contain up to five slots . a famous example is the verb ' to rent ' ( russian : arendovat ' - cf . apresjan ( 1974 ) p . 134 ) involving the following arguments : ( 1 ) who , ( 2 ) what , ( 3 ) from whom , ( 4 ) for how much , ( 5 ) for how long . special attention is devoted to the possibility of lexicon organisation in terms of derivations intended both to represent linguistic generalisations and to simplify the lexicon ( sections 1 . 13 - 1 . 15 ) . however , the method followed in the work is listing each item separately and supplementing the lexicon with redundancy rules that relate these lexical entries to each other . also , each sense of each predicate is treated as a separate item with its own case frame . in order to set the guidelines for applied cg textual analysis , a concise introduction to the principles of lexical decomposition and to the interpretation of covert case roles is given . lexical decomposition is understood as the process of analysing predicates as consisting of more basic atomic predicates . with some sentences this is unavoidable for determining the actual predicate-argument structure . covert case roles , which are required by the meaning of the predicate , are sometimes ( as in the case of partially covert ( deletable ) case roles ) or always ( as in the case of totally covert ( coreferential and lexicalised ) case roles ) missing in the surface structure . since the cg analysis advocated for in this book maintains the obligatory object hypothesis , covert roles assume greater importance . in all cases where the object role can be sometimes deleted , or can be coreferential with another role , or can be lexicalised into the predicate , a deeper analysis is needed to find the obligatory object . certainly , the lexicalisation of the manifestation of propositional , essential roles is of primary interest in the context of revealing the central predicate in a sentence . the assumption that a predicate , even with covert ( hidden ) case role , has to be defined in terms of its full complement of case roles requires a clear distinction between deletable , coreferential and lexicalised roles . the author offers in this respect not only theoretical background but also concrete tests , procedures and instructions to guide and facilitate practical analysis . two methodological principles are postulated ensuring that all conceptual relations flow from the central verb , and that deletable roles are included in case descriptions . a major asset of the book is , with no doubt , the extensive textual analysis performed with precision , consistency and conformity to the postulated principles and theoretical assumptions . the limits of the approach are realistically recognised by the author , and are stated explicitly in the appropriate places throughout the presentation . the reader will find a well-developed and detailed ontology of predicates , which covers not only verbs but also predicative adjectives , predicative nouns and predicative adverbs . the most important linguistic phenomena are considered in a systematic and easy-to - follow way . this makes the book a valuable guide to a practical sentence analysis , as well as a useful reference material for research purposes and computer applications . references apresjan , jurij d . 1974 : leksicheskaja semantika . sinonimicheskie sredstva jazyka . moskva : nauka blake , barry j . 1994 : case . cambridge textbooks in linguistics . cook , walter a . , s . j . 1989 : case grammar theory . washington , d . c . : georgetown university press . sowa , john f . 1984 : conceptual graphs : information processing in mind and machine . reading , mass . : addison -

A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA. \n\t\t\t\t\tColin Duwe\n\t\t\t\t\tAssociate Editor\n\t\t\t\t\tCNET Electronics\n              \t\tIn Palm OS:Â Most\tPopular Titles\nWeek ending June 111Noah Lite English dictionary2DopeWars (Palm)\n3Blocks\n4Palm Desktop5SketcherAll popular Palm OS downloads\nIn Pocket PC:Â Most Popular TitlesWeek ending June 111SimCity20002TV Remote Controller3GigaBar4ActiveSync\n5Syntact Gamebox (Pocket PC)\nAll popular PocketPC downloads\nMust-have Palm OS games: Newly updated\nWe've listened to reader suggestions, tested the latest games to be released, and now we're ready to present our current list of favorite games for your Palm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead the full story\nToshiba Pocket PC e740\nPowered by Intel's new 400MHz XScale processor and boasting integrated Wi-Fi connectivity, Toshiba's new PDA is an impressive mobile machine.

( he believes it will be possible to put a plan b through the assembly ) . ? hertzberg is personally committed to at least attempting to put a plan b through the legislature . this is because he is close to business and wants to see socal saved . he \" wants a win under his belt before he leaves the senate next year \" so that he can take that win into whatever he does next . davis has laid the burden of bailing out socal on hertzberg . hertzberg is determined to put a piece of legislation on the floor . however , he does not , at this time , know when this will happen , nor does he know what the share of the dedicated rate component will be for businesses and ratepayers , which remains a key sticking point . ? when asked about plan b ' s chances of passing the senate , hertzberg responded that , \" miracles can happen . \" ? hertzberg defended his idea of setting aside a trust as part of plan b for the generators to litigate over . he stated that his bankruptcy attorney believes that it will work , despite what goode ( the governor ' s attorney ) has said . sen . john burton : ? burton is aware that hertzberg is trying to put together plan b legislation and when asked about hertzberg ' s efforts , burton stated that in the senate \" plan b has no republican votes , and there are , at a minimum , 6 democrats that will vote against it . \" burton said that for a plan b bailout to pass the senate , it would have to have three elements : ? businesses would pay the entire dedicated rate component . ? the edison parent company would have to give the state $ 1 b . ? all creditors would have to take a 30 % haircut . ? burton wants senator bowen to hold hearings on the plan b that will run for at least 3 days , then have a \" long caucus . \" at that point the senate will either \" hold an up - or - down vote on whatever comes from the assembly or add amendments [ stating the three provisions above ] . \" burton wants \" all senators to know exactly what they ' re voting for or against . \" ? burton stated that he would \" bet against \" a plan b passing . \" this is not gonna happen , \" he stated . burton believes that a bailout deal would be bad for the democratic party .",

    "email": "\n    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say \"Cool; I can understand this\" and leave their shackles behind.  :)    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.\n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian FahrlÃ¤nder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad\nEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com\nICQ  5119262\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with\ncompassion and vision.

Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using \nthem to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a \nJudicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very \nsubstantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against \nanother and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.\nBUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these \nSHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment\nb) The court does not require the loser to pay you. \nc) The court will not help you to collect it. \nd) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling \nyou how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They \nmust trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank \naccounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER \nhas to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that \nBIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an \nexpense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in \nfiles and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the \nUnited States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of \nuncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, \n5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting \nother peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  \nThrough long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a \nprocess that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper \ninto a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the \ntechniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time \nmaking $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time \nassociates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per \nyear. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable \norganizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing \nover 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, \nnew judgments become available every day.  The work is\nALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. \nThis is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start \nsomething ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. \nIt is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to \nspend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT \nA GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  \nThe more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you \nwant to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom \nthis may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  \nThis business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. \nIt might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what\nto do.

Greg Curry, This Network World Fusion  article was sent to you by Geege\nGuten tag, y'all.\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------- \nHave you visited Network World Fusion yet? On www.nwfusion.com  you will find additional informative articles, primers and research on specific network technologies and products. Visit us today at www.nwfusion.com \n---------------------------------------------------------------- \n/news/2002/0819specialfocus.html:---------------------------------------------------------------- \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tP2P getting down to some serious work\n      \t\n \n    \n\t By John Fontana\n    Network World, 08/19/02\n\t\n Just a few years removed from the mayhem of music swapping that clogged corporate networks, peer-to-peer technology is growing up and rediscovering its roots as a legitimate concept for distributed computing in corporate environments and the Internet.The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus.For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.\n But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say.\nThe P2P evolutionRegardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage. \"Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,\" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. \"P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally.\" Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. \"Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides.\"Observers say it's a renaissance.\"P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,\" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. \"But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use.\"Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance. \"But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,\" he says.\nWorking togetherTo underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops.\"We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,\" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications.Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure.And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers.Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph.\"P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,\" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. \"The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing.\"And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product.P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P. \"Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,\" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation. \"Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,\" Duran says. \"One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that.\"Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data. \"P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,\" Duran says. \"It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P.\"That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing.\"P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,\" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi.And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Copyright 2001 Network World, Inc.

    "email": "a better investment than the stock market . all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet ! does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles . \" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank \" , says the 41 - year - old woman , \" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year \" . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of \" report \" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out \" , says the clever 15 - year - old . the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . \" i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \" , the boy continues . within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills . \" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \" . he goes on , \" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all \" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . \" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . \" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . \" surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called \" chain - letter \" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \" please send me report number xyx \" . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee . [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] . be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you say \" bull \" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are \" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost \" . due to the recent increase of popularity \u0026 respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible . this is what one had to say : \" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in \" . pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey . here is another testimonial : \" this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything . \" more testimonials later but first , print this now for your future reference + + + + order all 5 reports shown on the list below + + + for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name \u0026 number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 5 reports . you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer . within a few days you will receive , vie e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step \" 1 through 6 \" or you will loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward !

* * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that equals 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half million ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil \u0026 paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = order each report by its number \u0026 name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number \u0026 the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : r . r . po box 18048 chicago , il 60618 report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net order report # 2 from : gm boland 353 jonestown rd . suite 125 winston salem , nc 27104 report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : r . chernick po box 771661 c . s . florida 33077 report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm \u0026 the net order report # 4 from : m . eiseman po box 451971 sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971 report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : l . samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5 xp $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + more testimonials + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + \" my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago . i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving \" junk mail \" . i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it wouldn ' t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me !

This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,\nonly after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would\nbe stupid.

    "email": "Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\u003e What is the GPL all about then?(1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything\non a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU\nGPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware\nthat XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl\nArtistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that\nnumerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and\na whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any\nopen source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the\nGPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that\n_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you\nmay insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source\ncode.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights\nwhatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.\u003e But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!Again, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite\nconfident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's\nsource-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their\ndistribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms\nto someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any\nreasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.\n \n\u003e Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp\n\u003e version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy\n\u003e and giving it to me?See below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.\nSuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you\ndown to a judge, if that's what you're asking.\u003e Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not\n\u003e asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to\n\u003e burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable\n\u003e consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a\n\u003e couple of pints?).You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted\nwork to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if\nyou've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather\nimprecise concept of a \"Linux distribution\", which is a number of works\nunder diverse licence terms collected onto some media.In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate\nand redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the\napplications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are\nproprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,\nduplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is\ncopyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the\nGNU GPL is going to change that.(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the \"evaluation\" and\n\"live-eval\" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not \"for\nvalue\".)If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.\u003e What does the GPL mean now?Suggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.-- \nCheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.\nRick Moen\nrick@linuxmafia.com-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

160 pages , isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( \" john ran for half an hour \" ) , accomplishments ( \" john built a house \" ) and achievements ( \" john won the race \" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , \" start \" , \" begin \" , \" commence \" , \" initiate \" , \" resume \" ( for event beginnings ) , \" continue \" , \" keep \" ( for event middles ) and \" end \" , \" finish \" , \" terminate \" , \" halt \" , \" cease \" , \" complete \" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as \" start / finish \" , \" stop / resume \" , \" resume / finish \" , \" keep / end \" , \" continue / end \" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with \" end \" or \" finish \" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with \" have \" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as \" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation \" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . \u0026 reyle , u .

    "email": "URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde\nDate: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her \ncompany just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a \ntilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with \nremarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that \nreading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be \nhonest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind \nthat. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the \ntilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for â€œhome \ndirectoryâ€, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username \nwill take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to \ntheir Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can \ntrace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal \npages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to \nhave their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more \ncommonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html \nsubdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point \nyour browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files \nfrom that user's Sites directory within their home directory. But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in \nthis field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (\nold habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene \nWallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a \ntilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be \nused in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a \ntilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn \nthat the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd \ncharacter called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if \nindeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, \nto be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. \nThe tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the Ã± \n(now referenced in HTML as the named entity Ã±), but somewhere along \nthe line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky \nuses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for \n#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came \neven later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, \n1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee \nmeeting, when it was proposed â€œas exclusively a tilde in USA to appease \nSHAREâ€. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or \nwhat this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, \nwhen the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of \nyesterday called â€œDeja Newsâ€, and kids today call â€œGoogle \nGroupsâ€), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William \nSafire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially \npronounced â€œsquiggleâ€. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary\n[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was \ncool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various \nASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem\n[11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that \nFidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements \n(history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed \nin the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying \nbugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced â€œtildeâ€[20], prompting \nthis typographical pun[21]. And that's the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but \nthere are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the \ntilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for \nâ€œhome directoryâ€? When did it migrate into the world of web servers \nto provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web \nsites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing \nmy research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. \nMay you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.[1]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/\n[2]  http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/personal/bokonon.html#words\n[3]  http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings\n[4]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/tilde.html\n[5]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3627ac95.66099519%40news.cs.hut.fi\n[6]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=an_600051281\n[7]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/latin1/ascii-hist.html#7E\n[8]  http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html\n[9]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=735627391.AA02027%40Clone.his.com\n[10] http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/a/ASCII.html\n[11] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=14595%40shlump.nac.dec.com\n[12] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CMM.0.88.616446576.cmg%40watsun.cc.columbia.edu\n[13] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4036%40hoptoad.uucp\n[14] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=669%40kodak.UUCP\n[15] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3197%40jhunix.UUCP\n[16] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2428%40cal-asd.fluke.UUCP\n[17] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=778%40brl-bmd.UUCP\n[18] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2405%40decwrl.UUCP\n[19] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucf-cs.904\n[20] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucbcad.162\n[21] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.hp-pcd.546\n",

(That's why I'm holding on to\n\u0026\u003e EL\u003e My IBM Model M Space Saver. Once I get an PS2 to USB converter, I\n\u0026\u003e EL\u003e expect it will outlive several generations of computer hardware).The Fingerworks dvorty ergo keyboards are pretty good for that; unfold, plug\nthe USB port and go, but you don't get the angle unless you put the castiron\n(sort of) bracket (and optional gel palm-rests) in your pack.  Big airport fun there.\nThe flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.\n(The keyboard is $200-400, hence minor concern.)Kind of useless for keysigning though; is it not law that when you have to sign,\nyou will be packed and ready to leave/arrive elsewhere?  Thats why F-u-F-mi\nis such a handy accessible proxy signing method and Dragon Naturally\nAuthorized canceled its IPO.\n\tSeriously, the nifty Palm thing where you enter your password\nand (or by) a series of naturally cryptic buttonpressed and screentaps is a\ngood method.  Keyed steganography (\u003c---bad term! sorry) is it until I\nhear more about spoofed braille.[the below digresses to laptopianism]\u0026\u003e EL\u003e Very good for sticking in USB fobs into, though. CRTs/LCD panels are\n even \u0026\u003e EL\u003e better for that, though.The DPMS connector is supposed to do -what- again?\n\u0026\u003e \u003e\u003e near close to keyboard/usb connection as one can get, without the real\n\u0026\u003e \u003e\u003e thing)\u0026\u003e EL\u003e I think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the\n\u0026\u003e EL\u003e keyboard issue.Once you get something to cut the backlight power low when not needed for\nimage proofing (or off, in case of FLCD) and cache CDs as virtual devices,\nis battery life still bad?\u0026\u003e Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the\n\u0026\u003e Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure)  which promise a 4 hour\n\u0026\u003e battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive.  As far as\n\u0026\u003e the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good\n\u0026\u003e keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,\n\u0026\u003e alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I\n\u0026\u003e get restless).   I can't imagine surviving at Law school without a\n\u0026\u003e lappy, but thats just me.Once used to being surrounded by lawyers with webcams,\nI cant imagine being flummoxed dealing with courts.Lots of the tabletPCs have daylight readable FLCDs.  (From looking\nat http://www.infocater.com  I don't know where you'll get Microsoft \nTablet OS though.)   An item from their handy pres. below.\nSo after looking at Transmetazone, tell me where (also) stateside I'm \nsupposed to be\\ shopping for the new Made-for-Japan laptops?The Sony U series is all Crusoe, but then TigerDirect will be all grins\nto sell you a lappad that gets you to 10h on a P4m...maybe a P4, who's to\nsay Tulatin P4s can't do that massive multithreading trick.\n(Besides which, a brown cowpie-colored Dell 8200 with a \nGeForce4Go400-32 is ca. $1550, before you buy car adapters \nand firewire drives.  Popular in OpenGL law school.)Revamping the Sony C1 every year strikes me as a cruel joke though,\nand I don't know any tricks for using 1400x2800 virtual screens on\nthe lovely NEC LaVie MX and Versa Daylite (FLCDs, 1 yr old) or\nToshiba Libretto L5/080 knkw (the KW has 802.11b built in, maybe\nnot as good as the 22MBps version or .a)\u0026\u003e then again, I don't know what you do with your laptops, Gene :)\n----8\u003c ---ancillary.bar: disclaimer: Before the dollar fell below the euro.\n Return-Path:   \nDear Steve,Thank you for your inquiry regarding the Tablet PC's.

( 1998 ) . american english . oxford , u . k . : blackwell . isbn 0-631 - 20846 - 5 ( hardcover ) . rrp : us $ 59 . 95 ( hardcover ) 16 . 99 / us $ 29 . 95 the rich phonology of american \" accents \" is appreciated and instantly identifiable by non - american speakers of english worldwide , through television , radio and now ( perhaps ) through the internet . however , the perceived homogeneity of the american way of speaking as something uniquely \" american \" by these speakers of english , lies in stark contrast to the diversity of american english which is the domestic reality . in this exciting revision of wolfram 's classic \" dialects and american english \" , wolfram and schilling - estes not only attempt to provide a detailed account of the geographical and sociocultural distribution of certain kinds of american english , through distinct dialects , grammar , and usage , but also attempt to dispel a number of urban ( and not-so - urban ) myths common among native american english speakers . the book begins by contrasting the popular definition of \" dialects \" and their relative social desirability ( or otherwise ) , as perceived by native speakers who often feel they do not speak a dialect , with technical definitions from linguistics in the context of the so-called \" desirability-deficit \" debate . the work of schilling - estes in documenting the ocracoke english of north carolina , in particular , places her in a unique position to comment on language variation and the social issues involved in linguistic minorities ( especially in attempting to dispel myths regarding social desirability and dialects ) . the second chapter contrasts linguistic and sociohistorical explanations of the processes by which different dialects arise in languages , and more generally , why languages change over time . whilst the latter explanation sees languages and dialects as arising from the interaction of social and historical conditions , such as migration , settlement , and language contact , the former view sees languages as dynamical systems which have an inherent capacity and impetus to change , which arises from their structure . although some linguists are not directly concerned with sociohistorical factors in language change , the authors successfully integrate both viewpoints by examining general processes such as grammaticalization in the context of specific examples ( such as the new york city vernacular ) . however , those interested solely in a comprehensive review of distinctive american grammar , independent of social factors , should look elsewhere - this book is not a taxonomic ( and nor should it be ) . however , the third chapter which discusses levels of dialect should be useful for understanding the strata of dialects in contemporary american speech . the fourth chapter provides a historical overview of the development of american dialects , from elizabethan influences and pre-revolutionary dialects , to the rise of the west coast and twentieth century accents . this chapter successfully uses geographical diagrams and maps not only to demonstrate localised changes in distinctive dialect features ( such as r-lessness and r-fulness ) that have occurred throughout the history of the united states , but also to demonstrate the flow and influence of dialects during settlement of the interior , and how these changes are related to issues such as language contact and language borrowing from native americans . chapter 5 continues this process by developing examples of regional dialects and variations from many areas of the united states . chapters 6 and 7 develop the idea of dialects beyond regional and geographical differences to encompass dialect change and differences based on social class , ethnicity and gender . these chapters consider key issues such as the patterning of social difference in language in the context of specific examples , such as african american vernacular english ( aave ) . it is interesting to note in this example that even though at least eight distinctive grammatical features distinguish aave from the anglo american dialect , there is variation within each group sufficient to make comparisons difficult for linguists . a more general case is examined with respect to interactions of three or more languages , as is the case in robeson county nc , where native americans constitute 40 % of the county population , where their accent is clearly dominant . chapters 8 and 9 moves away from group analysis of dialects and language to questions of individual language use and style , and the social distribution of these usages . theories of style shifting , such as the attention to speech model , speech accommodation theory and the audience design model are reviewed , and research methods for understanding individual speech acts within paradigms that focus on group-based methods are discussed ( including corpus methods ) . group - exclusive dialect features and dialect patterning are discussed in the context of research methods such as implicational arrays to relate specific grammatical features of different dialects . the book concludes with discussions of the relevance of an understanding of accents and dialects to applied linguistics , an issue which is clearly important historically with the \" desirability-deficit \" debate and in contemporary education of english as a second language . in particular , the use of standardized tests which are based around the recognition of standard english usage and grammar are criticized for being unrealistic ( as well as violating assumptions of content validity ) . one solution might be to use a dialect consistency or achievement measure , and / or developing culturally and linguistically-appropriate testing situations which do not make assumptions about a language learner 's accent and / or social demographics . as the authors recognise , these kinds of aims are very difficult to implement , but certainly recognising the systematic biases in language testing , and encouraging dialect awareness in schools , is a first step . wolfram and schilling - estes explicitly accommodate pedagogical usage of this book , by introducing key concepts in capitals , and including an exercise for students with each new section in the text . at the conclusion of each chapter , there is a very useful \" further reading \" section which will also be useful to students , as will the glossary of common linguistic terms at the end of the book . a skeletal phonetics chart is accompanied by an appendix of socially-diagnostic structures , which will be useful for those working in clinical linguistics . the only criticism which could be levelled at the teaching material in the book is that no solutions are provided for the exercises , so perhaps the development of a separate teacher 's guide ( especially for foreign or tesol instructors ) might be an appropriate future inclusion to this otherwise impressive account of american english . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : \u003e hi , \u003e \u003e as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . \u003e martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some \u003e time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , \u003e etc . \u003e \u003e martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . \u003e \u003e we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about \u003e the following : \u003e * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly \u003e catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . \u003e \u003e * a description of what you want to talk about with respect \u003e to telecoms , broadband , etc . \u003e * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our \u003e boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . \u003e . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e look forward to hearing from you . \u003e \u003e regards , \u003e iris",

Might as well \nmaximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips \nwill apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing \nisn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this \nGnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. \nDownload Windows Productivity Tips now!  I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, \nya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of \nthe basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only \nmade it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted \nthe floor where that collection of stuff was previously \nstored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more \nstuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick \nferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next \nroom over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the \nmigration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret \ncage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure \nit's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws \nwith stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that \nthe ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped \nout heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely \ngetting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-\nproof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I \nmoved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds \nof the way through the first row, I found that the extra \n1/2\" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began \nrunning into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. \nFigures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. \nBack down to the basement I went to geek out instead. \nRoughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized \nit was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually \nstuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I \nreally could and still work on a couple of projects, but it \ndidn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot \noutside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added \nheat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower \nand with only the notebook in the living room for the \nbalance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient \nemail, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished \notherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD \ntomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could \nwatch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just \nthat. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back \nfrom DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac \nto see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In \ntheory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way \nthrough. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script \ntechnique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK\nSlow File Save Dialog Boxes\nPointed out by Ian Hargreaveshttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126\nI've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a \nhotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will \nwork best. I often map drive letters to specific network \nshares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll \nnotice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes \nin Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 \nattempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you \nthe list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped \nand how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take \neons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My \nNetwork Places functionality instead of mapping drive \nletters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters \nmapped for many things, being that I work at a command \nprompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. \nAlternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to \ncontact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you \nchoose.\nÂ GnomeSYSTEM\nCustomized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors\nhttp://www.vsres.com/blscrn/\nWe've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue \nscreens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide \nno real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer \nthat has had to deal with error conditions produced by \nWindows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle \nthem within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an \nActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error \nfunctions, but provides a way to pass along text and \nresponse options you designate. Note that this is not \nfunctional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors \nin an entirely different manner.Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset\nhttp://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532\nhttp://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513\nDiscount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when \nreading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. \nThe Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really \ndon't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is \nperformance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also \nlooking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that \nCelerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have \ntypically provided a decent enough experience that they can \nmake for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded \nconsumer. The compatibility issues with this particular \nversion of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to \nwatch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron \ncore, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but \nthe 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without \nadding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what \nhardware you're buying is what's important here.Â GnomeALERTZ\nToday's Top 5 kbAlertzQ296133 - WD2002: Recorded Macro to Create Right-to-Left Style Records Paragraph Alignment Incorrectly (Q296133)\nQ292152 - WD2002: Macro to Modify Currently Selected Text Does Not Work Correctly (Q292152)\nQ292150 - WD2002: Undo Command Does Not Remove List Style Link to Paragraph Style (Q292150)\nQ292094 - WD2002: Error Message: Microsoft Mail Local Fax Is Not Installed on Your System (Q292094)\nQ292078 - WD2002: New Document Created by Macro While Word Is Minimized Opens in Restored State (Q292078)CLEAN YOUR SYSTEM Add/Remove Plus! 2002 offers a new and better way \nto uninstall programs you no longer want on your computer.

Water-cooled \nsystems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those \nthat seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer \nsystems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and \napplying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook \ncomputers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very \nhot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and \nI have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my \nown little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling \nsystem Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat \nmitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of \na water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would \nwelcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open \narms.\nRecommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020722.html\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.

    "email": "the ldc united nations corpus in linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175",

    "email": "sex bias and epicenes h . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna 's ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , \u0026 elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like ' lumberjack ' and ' particpants in congressional sex scandal ' used more with he than say ' child , ' or ' teacher . ' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let 's not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i ' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n't want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) \" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

    "email": "\" sum : have / hold / compulsion / existence about a month ago , i posted an enquiry asking for help in finding non - ie languages , in which there was a connection between any of the following expressions : ' hold ' and ' possess ' , synchronically or diachronically ' exist ' and ' possess ' ' must / should ' and ' possess ' and i was quite happy about the enthusiastic reponse ( around 20 of you contacted me ) . so , for all who are interested , here is a short summary . i hope i have n't left anyone out and that i have n't confused anything , as i know next to nothing about the languages you all told me about . there was also the small 'd isaster ' with my email - i accidentally deleted some of your answers , so i apologize if you answered but do n't find your name in the list . i would like to take the chance now to thank all those who did answer with information on the following languages : japanese : here , the verb mot - ' hold ' can also be used to a large extent for ' possess ' , but not for ' existence ' or ' compulsion ' also , an anonymous reply pointed out another construction for ' possess ' with aru - ' exist ' , but was not sure about the difference in meaning between ' possess ' with mot - and ' possess ' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki ' hold ' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote ' possess ' and also ' perfect ' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan ' be ' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb ' possess ' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the \" dative \" ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between ' possess ' and ' compulsion ' and ' existence ' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction ' past participle + dative ( ' l ' ) + pronoun ' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda ' at / near / by ' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru ' be ( located ) ' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol ' hold ' , although not used for ' possess ' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : ' exist ' / ' not-exist ' is not only used for existence but also ' possess ' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa ' hold ' can also be used to express ' compulsion ' but interestingly , not ' possess ' . dakota : yuha ' hold ' may also be used to some extent for ' have ' , otherwise ' be with ' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes ' embrace ' , can also be used to express ' possess , own ' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes ' hold in one 's palm ' ( yiu3 is ' possess ' , ' existence ' and can also be used for ' perfect ' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh ' give ' -

    "email": "kitahara review . hisatsugu kitahara , ( 1997 ) elementary operations and optimal derivations , mit press , cambridge , mass . 140 pages , $ 15 . 00 . reviewed by julie legate , \u003c jlegate @ mit . edu \u003e this book is very firmly situated within the minimalist approach to syntactic theory that was begun by chomsky ( 1991 ) and perhaps most fully articulated in chomsky ( 1995 ) . it adopts much of the basic architecture of the 1995 version of minimalism ( henceforth mp ) , while deriving several of its principles and assumptions . the first three chapters of the book propose some comparatively minor alterations to the mp system , and demonstrate that these alterations allow several stipulations of the mp to be dropped , while retaining or improving the framework 's empirical coverage . the final chapter retains the proposals of the previous chapters while putting forth a new condition that is a more clear departure from the mp approach . with this condition , kitahara is able to account for several notoriously problematic wh-constructions . kitahara 's first chapter consists of a review of the minimalist syntactic framework . he discusses the conceptual foundation of the approach ( the unflinching application of occam 's razor to every aspect of the computational system ) , the guiding principles of global economy , as well as the internal mechanisms of the computation ( including the creation of syntactic trees through successive operations of merge and of morphological feature-driven move ) . his second chapter contains the core proposals of the book . kitahara replaces the operations of merge , move , and erase by two \" elementary operations \" : \" concatenation \" and \" replacement \" . concatenation is the procedure which joins two objects alpha and beta to form a new object k . replacement , on the other hand , substitutes an object alpha for an object beta , where beta is contained within a larger object sigma . the mp operations are redefined using these elementary operations as follows ( p35 ) : ( i ) cyclic merge = concatenation cyclic move = concatenation noncyclic merge = concatenation + replacement noncyclic move = concatenation + replacement erase = replacement he further redefines the shortest derivation condition ( chomsky 1991 , 1993 ; epstein 1992 ) in terms of these operations , as in ( ii ) ( p26 ) : ( ii ) shortest derivation condition ( sdc ) minimize the number of elementary operations necessary for convergence . given this technology , he proceeds to derive several of the principles and assumptions of mp . first , he considers cyclicity , providing a detailed summary and comparison of the approaches taken in chomsky 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . he derives that , in simple cases , cyclic convergent derivations should be preferred over noncyclic convergent ones , since cyclic operations yield a shorter derivation . as shown in ( i ) above , cyclic operations involve only one elementary operation : concatenation , whereas noncyclic ones require two : concatenation and replacement . next , he turns to the mp principle of procrastinate : covert movement ( i . e . movement which occurs in the computation after the derivation is sent to pf for pronunciation ) is preferable to overt movement . he separates the discussion into head movement , object shift , and expletive insertion . he adopts the mp assumptions that ( a ) movement results in two instances of identical elements , one in the merged position and the other in the moved position ( i . e . the copy theory of movement ) ; ( b ) if an element is overtly attracted , the entire category moves , whereas if an element is covertly attracted , only the formal features move ; and ( c ) only one of the identical elements created by movement is interpreted at lf . finally , he proposes a novel interpretation of effect of strong features in the grammar , as in ( iii ) ( p37 ) : ( iii ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . regarding head movement , in languages with overt verb raising , t has a strong v feature and thus overt raising is necessary for convergence . in languages without overt verb raising , the sdc selects derivations with covert , rather than overt , verb raising . although both covert and overt head movement involve one operation of replacement ( since head movement is necessarily non-cyclic ) , kitahara claims that overt head movement , being category movement requires an additional instance of replacement , thus resulting in a longer derivation . his reasoning is as follows . if a verb moves overtly , its semantic features are carried along . therefore , at lf it will be necessary to delete one of the instances of the semantic features , since elements are only interpreted once . this requires an application of replacement that is not needed for covert movement , since covert movement only affects the formal features , not the semantic features as well . notice that the same reasoning will not extend to phrasal movement . overt movement will require one instance of replacement to delete the semantic features of one member of the chain ( just considering a simple two-membered chain ) , however covert movement will also require one instance of replacement , since covert movement is necessarily non-cyclic . thus , the sdc cannot choose between derivations with overt object shift and those without . this predicts the optionality of object shift in languages like icelandic , without resorting to the mp ' optional strong feature ' analysis , which is a simple restatement of the facts . in languages without overt verb movement , object shift is predicted to be impossible , assuming that the object shifts to the outside specifier of vp , the inside specifier being the merged position of the subject , and that multiple specifiers are not equidistant from a higher head , unless head movement renders them equidistant . thus , the shifted object would block movement of the subject to tp , unless the verb has raised to t . kitahara acknowledges ( p144 , fn26 ) , however , that he cannot explain languages like french , that display overt verb raising but prohibit object shift . finally , kitahara considers the timing of expletive insertion . notice that although mp assumes that merge is cheaper than move , kitahara 's reanalysis predicts that merge be equally economical to cyclic move , since both consist of one application of concatenation . since the timing of expletive insertion is the primary empirical motivation for the mp assumption , kitahara demonstrates that this timing is equally captured within his system . consider the familiar sentences ( iv ) and ( v ) . ( iv ) there seems to be a man in the room . ( v ) * there seems a man to be in the room . in ( iv ) , the expletive was inserted in the embedded [ spec , t ] and raised to the matrix tp . in ( v ) , on the other hand , \" a man \" was raised to the embedded tp and the expletive was inserted directly into the specifier of the matrix tp . mp claimed that ( iv ) is preferred over ( v ) because it is cheaper to merge the expletive into the embedded tp than to move the associate . kitahara claims that these facts follow from his sdc . since expletives are assumed to have no semantic features , overt raising of \" there \" will not require an application of replacement to delete an instance of semantic features in ( iv ) . in ( v ) , on the other hand , overt raising of \" a man \" will require replacement to delete one of the resulting two instances of the semantic features of \" a man \" . therefore , the derivation in ( iv ) is shorter than that in ( v ) and thus preferred . as a side point , notice that this analysis requires that the formal features of \" a man \" raise covertly directly to the matrix t . if these features raised to the embedded tp covertly , the non-cyclic movement would result in an additional application of replacement , and ( iv ) and ( v ) should be equally economical ( an equivalent situation to object shift ) . kitahara concludes chapter two with a note about the timing of expletive insertion in icelandic transitive expletive constructions . he assumes the mp analysis that the associate ( i . e . the subject of the transitive ) moves into the inner specifier of tp and the expletive merges into the outer specifier of tp , the verb appearing between the two as a verb-second phenomenon . he notes that although this situation is the opposite of the english situation discussed above , i . e . here category movement precedes expletive insertion , this is predicted by the restriction against downwards movement . assuming the associate must move to adjoin to the expletive at lf , the associate must appear lower than the expletive , in order for this movement to be raising rather than lowering . in chapter three , kitahara demonstrates that chomsky 's ( 1995 ) minimal link condition can explain phenomena which had previously received disparate analyses in the literature . ( vi ) minimal link condition ( mlc ) h ( k ) attracts alpha only if there is no beta , beta closer to h ( k ) than alpha , such that h ( k ) attracts beta . kitahara begins with relativized minimality ( chomsky 1993 ) violations , as in ( vii ) , and superiority condition violations , as in ( viii ) . ( vii ) * john seems it is t ( john ) certain to be here . ( viii ) * what did you persuade whom to buy t ( what ) ? the mlc accounts naturally for these facts : in ( vii ) , \" it \" is closer than \" john \" to the matrix t , and thus blocks attraction of \" john \" ; in ( viii ) , \" whom \" is closer to the matrix cp than \" what \" and thus blocks attraction of \" what \" . next , kitahara considers proper binding condition violations , like that shown in ( x ) . ( ix ) proper binding condition traces must be bound . ( x ) * which picture of t ( who ) do you wonder who john likes t ( which picture of t ( who ) ) ? he argues that a proper binding condition analysis of ( x ) is no longer available in minimalist approaches . this condition can no longer apply at s - structure , since s - structure has been eliminated from the model , and lf reconstruction of \" picture of t ( who ) \" could create a configuration in which the trace of \" who \" is bound . instead , kitahara offers an mlc solution . he observes that ( x ) involves two violations of the minimal link condition . first , \" which \" is closer to the embedded cp than \" who \" and thus blocks the attraction of \" who \" ( note that \" picture of who \" would be necessarily carried along with \" which \" to the embedded cp by an independent convergence condition ) . second , given the illegitimate attraction of \" who \" to the embedded cp , \" who \" becomes closer to the matrix cp than \" which \" , and thus blocks the attraction of \" which \" . assuming that ( xi ) a derivation employing a greater number of illegitimate steps induces a greater degree of deviance ( p72 ) the derivation in ( xii ) below is preferred over ( x ) because ( x ) involves two violations of the mlc whereas ( xii ) involves only one . ( xii ) ? ? who do you wonder which picture of t ( who ) john likes t ( which picture of who ) ? kitahara extends this analysis to crossing versus nesting dependency data . ( xiii ) nested dependency condition ( pesetsky 1987 ) if two \" wh \" - trace dependencies overlap , one must contain the other . the paradigm cases are those in ( xiv ) and ( xv ) : ( xiv ) ? ? what did you wonder whom john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? ( xv ) ? * whom did you wonder what john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? in ( xiv ) , kitahara observes , the mlc is disobeyed once , in the raising of \" what \" over \" whom \" to the matrix cp . in ( xv ) , on the other hand , the mlc is disobeyed twice , once in the raising \" what \" over \" whom \" to the embedded cp , and a second time in the raising of \" whom \" over \" what \" to the matrix cp . thus , following ( ix ) , the grammar prefers ( xiv ) over ( xv ) . finally , kitahara considers scrambling and topicalization in german and japanese , demonstrating that certain restrictions on these phenomena can also receive an mlc treatment . he assumes that both phenomena are feature driven , and that the scrambling / topicalization feature of the attracted element is interpretable , and thus remains accessible to the computation after checking . the basic pattern considered is that it is not possible to scramble an element from a constituent and then scramble the remnant , however it is possible to then topicalize the remnant . german examples are provided in ( xvi ) and ( xvii ) : ( xvi ) scrambling + scrambling of remnant * dass [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) that ( the book ) to read no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht hat tried has \" that no one has tried to read the book \" ( xvii ) scrambling + topicalization of remnant [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] hat keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) ( the book ) to read has no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht tried \" no one has tried to read the book \" under these assumptions , ( xvi ) violates the mlc twice , first by scrambling the dp \" that book \" over the closer vp \" that book to read \" , and second by scrambling the vp \" t ( that book ) to read \" over the now-closer dp \" that book \" . ( xvii ) , on the other hand , does not violate the mlc at all . assuming that the features that drive topicalization and scrambling are distinct , \" that book \" would be the closest available element with the scrambling feature to the attracting head , since \" that book to read \" would have a topicalization feature rather than a scrambling feature . similarly , the vp \" t ( that book ) to read \" is the closest available element to be attracted for topicalization , since \" that book \" has a scrambling feature not a topicalization feature . in chapter four , kitahara discusses the differences in deviance between derivations which involve one violation of the mlc by a wh-element . he provides the generalization in ( xviii ) , and examples in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) ( p83 - 85 ) : ( xviii ) an mlc violation involving adjuncts , subjects , or quasi objects [ i . e . \" how many \" phrases ] is far more severe than an mlc violation involving objects . ( xix ) adjunct * how do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( how ) ? ( xx ) subject * what do you wonder [ whether t ( what ) was fixed t ( what ) ] ? ( xxii ) quasi - object * how many pounds do you wonder [ whether john weighed t ( how many ) ] ? ( xxii ) object ? ? what do you wonder [ whether john fixed t ( what ) ] ? in order to explain this phenomenon , kitahara proposes the following condition ( p90 ) : ( xxiii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or \u003e 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) and assumes that traces may be attracted ( at least covertly ) . he claims that the illegitimate wh-movements in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) do not form a chain . therefore , the wh-elements will not be able to be interpreted at lf , causing the derivation to crash . this accounts for the ungrammaticality of ( xix ) - ( xxii ) . in ( xxii ) , however , kitahara claims that the formal features of the trace of \" what \" raise covertly to check accusative case , and that it is this movement that saves the derivation . ( notice that covert movement of the traces of the wh-elements in ( xxiv ) - ( xxvi ) will not occur . adjuncts and quasi objects do not check case , and subjects move overtly to check case . ) according to the chain formation condition , the movement of the formal features of the object , being legitimate , may form one or more chains ; in particular , it forms a chain between the raised position of \" what \" in the matrix cp and the merged position of \" what \" . thus , the derivation can be interpreted at lf , and has only the status of a mlc violation . kitahara extends the analysis to ( xxiv ) . ( xxiv ) \" where \" / \" when \" adjuncts ? ? where / when do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( where / when ) ? he assumes that these adjuncts are the complement of a null preposition . therefore , the formal features of the trace of \" where \" / \" when \" must raise covertly to check case with the null preposition , again creating the necessary chain between the moved position of \" where \" / \" when \" in the matrix cp and its merged position . this chapter concludes the book . although this book stands solidly on the foundations of previous minimalist syntactic research , it remains accessible to those who are not well-versed in minimalist theory . it provides very clear explanations of the details of previous minimalist approaches , as well as kitahara 's own proposals . furthermore , all relevant derivations are presented step-by - step , at a pace designed to accommodate the non-specialist . thus , it presents a good opportunity for those interested to learn about research and issues in minimalist syntax . those who are familiar with minimalist research should find this to be an interesting reworking and application of 1995 - style minimalism . anyone convinced by recent discussions of computational complexity and local economy ( see collins 1997 , johnson \u0026 lappin 1997 , yang 1997 , among others ) , however , will be dissatisfied with the approach , as it continues to rely on global economy conditions . since , of course , not everyone has been convinced by the discussion , this is more a note to prospective readers than a criticism . on a similar note , a crucial assumption for the analyses is that the grammar can count , which is controversial , but not obviously false . note that , regarding cyclicity , the notoriously problematic case of head - movement , which chomsky ( 1995 ) managed to incorporate into \" cyclicity \" requirements ( forcing it to apply before introduction of another head into the derivation ) , again falls outside the analysis of \" cyclicity \" . since all head - movement will require an operation of replacement , there is no longer any clear way to force it to apply before another head is introduced . perhaps more serious is the reformulation of the strong feature condition . the various strong feature conditions of previous minimalist approaches are simplified in the first chapter to ( ii ) above , repeated in ( xxv ) below . ( xxv ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . the difficulty with this formulation is that it renders the strong feature condition an s - structure condition and thus anti - minimalist , since minimalism took great pains to eliminate all s - structure conditions . notice that it would be trivial to reformulate all previous s - structure conditions in a manner parallel to ( xxv ) - - \" spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no traces which are not bound \" - - thus reducing the minimalist claim that s - structure is redundant to a matter of terminology only . furthermore , in the last chapter , a further condition involving strong features had to be introduced in order to rule out certain noncyclic derivations . this additional condition , given in ( xxvi ) , is essentially a weakened version of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) formulation of the strong feature condition . ( xxvi ) alpha and beta cannot be concatenated if some sublabel of alpha and some sublabel of beta are both strong ( p95 ) thus , the proposed simplification of the strong feature condition actually results in positing two conditions , one of which is an s - structure condition . another seemingly anti - minimalist proposal is the chain formation condition , given in ( xxiii ) above and repeated in ( xxvii ) below . ( xxvii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or \u003e 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) minimalist theory claims that the computation of human language meets the inclusiveness condition , i . e . no new elements are added during the course of the computation . instead , the computation arranges and rearranges items selected from the lexicon . therefore , under minimalist theory , the notion of a \" chain \" as an independent entity does not exist , as it would have to be added during the course of the derivation , violating inclusiveness . instead , \" chain \" is simply a convenient term used to refer to the identical elements in a derivation . the chain formation condition , however , crucially requires chains to have an independent existence in the computation . these comments aside , this book does represent a step forward in the minimalist research program . kitahara is able to derive several assumptions / principles which previously could only be stipulated . the account of optionality in icelandic object shift is more satisfying than the \" optional strong feature \" approach , although , as was noted , it does raise some cross - linguistic considerations ( e . g . french ) . the systematic application of the minimal link condition to data captured by various other conditions was sorely needed , if only to confirm the intuitions that an mlc would have equal , or superior , empirical coverage . finally , the analysis of \" wh \" extraction asymmetries presented in the final chapter , is one of the few minimalist treatments of this phenomenon . all in all , the reader will find this book to be very well considered , clearly explained , and thought-provoking . biography julie anne legate is a phd student in the department of linguistics and philosophy at mit . her research interests include syntactic theory and irish syntax . bibliography chomsky , noam .

    "email": "re : storage model : simple issues brad , here are my thoughts on your concerns . * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves before the system is properly set up . * intrinsic value vs time value : the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a rough idea about the allocation as you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the model . the difference between the total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options . in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value . * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model is expressed in the form covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are the implied volatilities from the vol curve . ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small ) where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) . let me know if i can offer further help . zimin brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect subject : storage model : simple issues zimin : thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied to implementation and calibration : model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32 in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases . meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running quickly ? sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research . intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to share this with you to ask the following : does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently than the simple difference proposed ? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ? my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of the time spreads . factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3 factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage valuation ! ! ! ) ? calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the data when we are and model results once im up and running .",

    "email": "kornfilt : turkish jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york : routledge . xxxi + 575 pp . 110 , us $ 180 . reviewed by steve seegmiller , montclair state university . jaklin kornfilt 's grammar of turkish ( hereafter referred to as turkish ) is the first new , comprehensive grammar of this language to be published in english in more than two decades . as such , its appearance is a significant event , especially since its author is a well known and respected authority on turkish . this is the latest title in the descriptive grammars series , edited by bernard comrie and published by routledge . the goals of the works in this series are different from those of most grammars : the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of \" basic vocabulary , \" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language . ' ( it is actually s - o - v . ) a sentence on page 30 , which addresses the of question whether pied-piping of postpositions is obligatory , leaves the reader unsure of the answer . there are also some contradictions . on page 142 , the claim is made that the reflexive can never occur in subject position , but on page 305 we learn that the reflexive can occur as an honorific subject and on page 542 three references are given to works that discuss reflexive subjects in subordinate clauses . other inconsistencies are found in the bibliography , where some turkish titles are translated into english and others are not . the author is aware of some of the errors and has prepared an addendum which contains a short list of errata , but many of the errors that i found are not included . the addendum is available free of charge from the author or the publisher . my other complaint concerns the cost of turkish . at us $ 180 , the grammar is unlikely to find its way into many private libraries . this is unfortunate ; since the book is so useful , linguists interested in turkish will want to have it close at hand . references lewis , g . l .

He was\nwilling to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried\nthat it would be \"a more juicy target,\" the kind of deep pockets that\nmight make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's\nunderstandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would\ntake a stand on the right side of this issue.So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on\nthings like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration.

    "email": "your attention is needed attn : i pray this important message meets you in peace , may blessings of god be upon you and your family and grant you the wisdom to understand my situation and how much i really need your assistance . before i start let me introduce myself , my name is mrs . alice bamaiyi the wife of gen . musa bamaiyi nigeria ? s former army chief of staff and minister of defence under the military government of late head of state , gen . sanni abacha . since after my husband left office , the government has turned against my husband and his family with strange accusation . at first i thought it was a little vendetta from my husband ? s enemies but i was wrong . the present head of state , gen . olusegun obasanjo very much believed that it was my husband and the late head of state who put him in prison for plotting against their government and he is determined to have his own pound of flesh now . they arrested my husband and then they froze all our bank accounts known to them , hoping that we will starve to death why can ? t we all live in peace ? since i can ? t do anything in my position here , this is where you come in . my family is going through hardship , my husband is in jail and the remaining members of my family and myself where previously placed under house arrest before the timely intervention of the human organization . the new democratic president , olusegun obasanjo has seized more than us $ 45 million dollars already and they are still seizing a lot of land and property belonging to my family . all that is remaining now is us $ 19 . 2 million dollars , and this money has been kept in a place i cannot disclose , until we make personal contact . presently i am based in south africa with two of our kids trying to start a new life we cannot live comfortable again in nigeria so my husband advice that we move to one of his house in cape town pending when his travail will come an end and also we are being seriously watched by the new government . so after discussing with my senior son , and husband , this is what we plan to do with the money , we seek the assistance of a foreign partner with good background without any dealing with drug or terrorist activities to act as a front on our behalf we planned to send the fund to your country using a very good and reliable diplomatic courier / financial institution service in central europe . so this is why we need a foreign partner and your help . since you will be the one collecting the package in the country that it will be sent to , the sum will be shared in three ways . 20 % will be used to invest in your country or company while 30 % will be for you and the other 50 % will be for us . and also confidentiality is extremely important and before i forget once the sum arrives in the designated country ( which i will disclose to you later ) we will require you to send us an invitation letter to visit your country upon our release and collect our share . this is not a deal or business , it is cry for help . may god guide you ? when you reply please leave your contact details private phone and fax numbers for easy communications , my personal assistant and friend mr . pachico mzama will speak to you . he will relate all your messages to me , and if you wish to talk to me just tell him and he will make all the necessary arrangement . and for your own information you are not spending a cent or rand or dollar in this transaction i will personally take care of all financial matters as far as this transaction is concern and this money is drug free and 100 % risk free and very legitimate . please time is very paramount us , so your urgent response is needed . above , you will see my phone number , you can send me a email or call me but i would prefer email correspondence , but if you wish to discuss about anything you do not understand contact my family lawyer who is presently in europe on long vacation on this tel . number : 31 - 625 - 247 - 423 for more briefing and clarification . may god bless you ? mrs alice bamaiyi",

    "email": "on rules re guido vanden wyngaerd ( 3-357 ) : i must break my longish silence caused by a few urgent jobs : \u003e since nyman does n't seem to begin to understand \u003e what the problem is here , let me expand on my question once more : we find \u003e that speakers * observe * ( not violate ) the wh-island constraint ; we find \u003e that they form yes-no questions by having recourse to hierarchical \u003e structure rather than linear precedence , i . e . they unfailingly produce ( 1a ) \u003e rather than ( 1b ) : \u003e \u003e ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? \u003e b is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? i must admit my dull-wittedness . sorry about that ! i also agree that a real issue is involved here . \u003e if speakers proceeded on the basis of inductive generalisation or analogy \u003e or some such principle , one would expect a more or less random distribution \u003e over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) in the acquisition stage , quod non . why would a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) be expectable in the acquisition stage , if speakers unfailingly - - and so , as the only pattern for children to base inductive generalizations on - - produce ( 1a ) ? \u003e hence speakers \u003e possess a certain knowledge or follow certian rules , and one would like to \u003e know where they get this knowledge from . are you suggesting chomskyan \" tacit \" knowledge ? if so , then you might think that rules grow in people 's minds like biological organs . \u003e the question now is : how can one tell if rules speakers \u003e follow , such as the wh-island rule or the yes-no question formation rule , \u003e are grules or lrules ? where does the conviction come from that speakers \" follow \" the wh-island rule ? this rule , as formulated and so named by a grammarian , is clearly a theoretical generalization ( grule ) . notice that the phenomenon here captured in insular terms is in principle amenable to a different theoretical formulation : e . g . , in dick hudson 's word grammar ( _ english _ word _ grammar _ . oxford 1990 ) , which is a dependency-based approach , ( 1b ) would be ruled out by the fact that it infringes the adjacency principle ( not to be confused with gb 's adjacency ) . while it is grammatically correct to say ( 2a ) is the man who is tall in the room ? , it would be grammatically incorrect ( and nonsensical ) to say ( 2b ) * is the man who tall is in the room ? in my terminology , ( 2a - b ) are technically rule-sentences which exemplify ( and witness for the existence ) of the corresponding norm of language ( lrule ) . it is typical of norms that they may be violated by mistake or by joke ( cf . alexis manaster ramer 's [ 3-371 ] posting on _ man _ the _ as a [ putatively ] possible np ) ; sometimes also by force , in order to bring home a theoretical point [ e . g . ( 1b ) above ] . lrules ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural facts ) are typically learned or acquired by experience . but some norms are so deeply rooted in human nature that their violation is more or less unnatural and requires an extra effort . ( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i ' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the ' two-leg ' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . \u003e and what merit is there to making such a distinction \u003e at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians ' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland",

So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization.The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the \"Medieval Warm Period\". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.A good link is: http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100\u0026CID=2051- 060302A \u003e -----Original Message----- \u003e From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Jim \u003e Whitehead \u003e Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM \u003e To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org \u003e Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming \u003e \u003e \u003e Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote: \u003e \u003e \u003eand say hello to the cool: Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause \u003e \u003e some stir ... \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e Of course not.

There's no question that adding more header\nfields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only\nbecause my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without\ngetting major benefits for bogus reasons.Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several\naccounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm\n(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the\nreason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer\nreported good results from this scheme:    ip_re = re.compile(r'(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3})')    for header in msg.get_all(\"received\", ()):\n        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):\n            parts = ip.split(\".\")\n            for n in range(1, 5):\n                yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n])This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled\nfor now.",

You said \"that was great, but you only told half the story\". You wanted to know two more things:How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users\nHow to secure the FTP ServerThere are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as \"Server Publishing\". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.\nRight click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.\nClick on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.\nClick the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.\nNow click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!\nk OK\nClick OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a \"dynamic DNS service\". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.Until next week,\nTom Shinder, Editor\n(email us with feedback: feedback@winxpnews.com)\nÂ Â Â SPONSOR: Is Your PC Spying On You?\nÂ You are surfing the Web.

If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.\nRight click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.\nClick on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.\nClick on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.\nThat should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.\nIf you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?\nÂ Â Â HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES\nÂ \nHow to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional\nLast week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.\nRight click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.\nClick on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.\nThe Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.\nPut a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.\nClick on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in \"clear text\", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.\nClick the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.\nClick on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.\nRight click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.\nClick on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.\nÂ Â Â WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES \u0026 PATCHES\nÂ \nCumulative Patch for Windows Media Player\nI think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a \"cumulative\" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another \"cumulative\" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:\nhttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_PatchYou'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.\nCumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows\nIf you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:\nhttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-Word_Excel_Patch\nÂ Â Â UPGRADING \u0026 COMPATIBILITY ISSUES\nÂ \nA Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem\nIf your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!\nhttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem\nKnowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!\nIt wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to \"fix\" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.Try this: go to:\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US\u0026pr=kbinfo\u0026\nand on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.\nÂ Â Â WINXP CONFIGURING \u0026 TROUBLESHOOTING\nÂ \nA Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection\nHere's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that \"Repair\" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:Sends an ipconfig /renew\nFlushes the ARP cache with a arp -d\nReloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R\nUpdates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR\nClear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns\nReregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdnsCheck out the original article over at:\nhttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Repair_Option\nKeyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows\nHave you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:\nhttp://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Frozen_Mouse\nHow to Deploy Windows XP Images from Windows 2000 RIS Servers\nAre you planning to roll out lots of Windows XP computers on your network in the near future?

    "email": "(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  Dr. Kataga Bakori\nLagos, Nigeria.\n23rd July 2002\nAttention President/C.E.O\n                   \nDear Sir,REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as \nbeing utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council \n(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade \nexhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with \nyou in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and \nhope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and \nprojects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our \ncontrol as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, \nwhich we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a \nforeign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual \naccount to receive the funds.The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria \nwhich lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded \nthemselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The \npresent civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors \nand as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we \nhave identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue \nof our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was \ntherefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas \npartner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY \nONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed \nso as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government \nfinancial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation \nof some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria \n(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or \nany other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main \npartner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of \naccount information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for \npayment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, \nand prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.

    "email": "acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough \"powers of ten\" in there to justify hardware acceleration. Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new \"email chip\" - allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w/ more important things .. like listening to MP3s..Best, Paul Sholtz-----Original Message----- From: Rohit Khare To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Sent: 8/27/02 3:00 PM Subject: DataPower announces XML-in-siliconNo analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. But here's the rawbits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration device ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer August 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in afamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. TheDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses.\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size upto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML.\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the companyitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false. Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytesand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection ofXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an applicationco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch inMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.======================================================================== =DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions ofproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.======================================================================== =DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneerin XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.

DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower Technology.\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thatâ€™s critical to Webservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A singleDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversâ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowerâ€™s patent-pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with DataPowerâ€™s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls.\"\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidlygrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is ontheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML Generation Three (XG3)Â technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date.\"\"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services,\" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. \"DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that relyon XML for mission critical applications.\"About Venrock Associates Venrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs that now spans over seven decades.

    "email": "Paul, my apologies for being irritable on the subject.  I'll tone down\nthe rhetoric.Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\u003e Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for\n\u003e example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions. \n\u003e \n\u003e Which is no problem - I don't see why that should be a problem for\n\u003e SuSE though - surely the more the merrrier as far as they're\n\u003e concerned.Anything either you or I have to say about their motivation is\nspeculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make\nmoney from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions\navailable for almost-unrestricted distribution (not \"for value\") via CD\nduplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for\nboxed-set sales.For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the \"FTP edition\" \nin ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they\nsee the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the\nmoment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to\nbuy boxed sets, instead.  Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the\n\"evaluation\" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it\nseveral versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a\nboxed set, after \"evaluating\" SuSE via the ISO image.Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All\nwe know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a\nbit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,\nYaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other\nutilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every\nright to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.\u003e One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't understand was that SuSE\n\u003e had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to\n\u003e use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence.Hmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that\nit's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without\nhis permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would\nmake that possible.The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,\nand is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse\nlicences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence\nstatement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of\ncopyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say\nthat it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to\nhave open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence\nfrom the copyright holder.)No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software\nwithout their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur\nat all. \n \nYou cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing\nit under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at\nall other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you\nsimply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright\nviolation.\u003e I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and\n\u003e customisation, rather than what I thought of as the core \"product\". I\n\u003e thought that the likes of Yast came under core - maybe it worked in\n\u003e the glory days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that they might\n\u003e want to make more money, but the way in which they have done it, seems\n\u003e to me, to be be against the spirit of the GPL.If Stallman and friends at the GPL (let alone Linus Torvalds and kernel\ncontributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same\nCDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores\n(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they\ncould and would have done so.Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give\nyou copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was\nrequire that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to \nbe able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew\nexactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed\nsoftware is exactly what they had in mind.\n \n\u003e All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under the impression that for\n\u003e *_those_* all one needed was to pay for the media and not for the code\n\u003e itself?\n\u003e \n\u003e Ai-je tort?Mais si.You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of\nthe GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy\nof any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to\nmatching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered\nbinary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the\ndistributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide \nexactly that access.Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed\ncodebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source\ncode they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us\nwhich codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not\nany of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)\u003e My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for\n\u003e the cost of the media plus a token of one's appreciation (the latter\n\u003e being subject to agreement between the parties) - I was offering a\n\u003e bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two and a chat for a copy - I\n\u003e don't know what the going rate is.Your understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access\nprovisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.\n(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered\nbinaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually\nplaced under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of \nplacing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL\nit.In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from\nenemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers\nthat using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings\nwill \"taint\" their copyrights and force them to put their property under\nthe GPL.  It's simply not so.\u003e If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and\n\u003e one for which I would be willing to pay.That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed\nsets free of charge and lawful to duplicate \u0026 redistribute, or \"borrow\".\nFor one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of\ncomponents, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_\nproprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)\nto hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in\nthe first place.\n \n\u003e I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent\ndistribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include\nsome other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to\nfind them being copied or \"borrowed\". \u003e I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can\n\u003e borrow them, but not copy them? No.Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be\nlawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,\nthen _not_ erasing it but merely letting you \"borrow\" the CDs results in\nthe product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised\ncopying.\u003e And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,\n\u003e trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE\n\u003e appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up\n\u003e proprietary and open stuff.Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera\neDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,\neither.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,\nLinux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail\nsets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.\n \n(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing\nquestion.)-- \nCheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.\nRick Moen\nrick@linuxmafia.com-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

    "email": "judgment fatigue : summary , part i summary of responses to request for information on judgment fatigue ( also called syntactic satiation ) original post : linguist list : vol-6 - 974 . mon jul 17 1995 . issn : 1068-4875 . special thanks to the following respondents : kimberly barskaitiki , tim beasley , elizabeth bergman , michael bernstein , vivian cook , joseph davis , rianne doeleman , karen emmorey , suzette haden elgin , ted harding , stephen helmreich , erika l . konrad , john e . limber , bruce nevin , john robert ross , carson t schutze , linda shockey , william snyder , karin stromswold , joyce tang boyland , anyone i may have missed , and anyone who thought about responding but has n't yet . karin stromswold and william snyder have actually investigated this phenomenon . i have not read either of their papers yet , but i look forward to doing so . william snyder ( snyder @ psyche . mit . edu ) presented a poster on this topic at lsa 1994 , which was mentioned in rick hudson 's summary post of july 29 , 1994 . individual 's interested in dr . snyder 's poster should contact him directly . hudson 's post ( linguist list : vol-5 - 855 . fri 29 jul 1994 . issn : 1068-4875 . ) summarized the literature available which addresses the difference between linguists ' and non-linguists ' intuitions . hudson also mentions ( but does not cite ) four references provided by joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects ( both syntactic and semantic ) . hudson 's original post is available from linguist list archives . joyce tang boyland 's response is included below ( in part ii of post , following ) . karin stromswold 's response ( karin @ muddle . rutgers . edu ) was my connection to snyder , hudson , and boyland . her post is most relevant to my original query and is included in its entirety below ( in part ii of post , following ) . most responses mentioned the influence of continual or repeated exposure over a period of time , either mentioning examples similar to perceptual or semantic satiation such as a word-repetition effect . ( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and \" syntactic satiation \" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold 's post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters ' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual 's attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson 's post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the \" scanting out \" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously \" great - - grammatical \" or \" horrible - - ungrammatical \" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed ' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . ' to quote from bruce nevin 's response : \u003c \u003c a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : ' i think he used to be . ' \u003e \u003e hudson 's previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term \" drift \" of linguists ' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of \" judgment drift \" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as \" weak crossover \" or \" island constraints \" , for example ) may actually alter an individual 's criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual 's discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual 's personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener 's / reader 's focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , \" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . \" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , \" i ' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n't feel like a native english speaker ! \" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .",

Programmers can spend hours inlining\ncode and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best\nperformance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no\nsense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -\nsuch as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most\napplications.One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call.\nMost database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of\ninstruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost\nsaving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline\noptimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.- Matthew (who really should be writing code)\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

It's\ncompletely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to\nsee. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for\nthemselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to\ndetermine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point\nsomething becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\"The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly\nineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about\na 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,\napparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted\nthe item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to\nwaste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to\na series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO./\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\n                               Patrick Greenwell\n         Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers\n\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my \u003e \u003e father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a \u003e \u003e motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation \u003e \u003e now. \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then \u003e \u003e their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce. Again, these \u003e \u003e situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship \u003e \u003e is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he \u003e \u003e doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished \u003e \u003e and teeming with AIDS. A contract, versus a true love-interest \u003e \u003e marriage. \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e Egh. I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent. I \u003e \u003e blame law school and my cat. \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e -BB \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e ALB\u003e - Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg \u003e \u003e ALB\u003e http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ \u003e \u003e ALB\u003e beberg@mithral.com \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e -- \u003e \"I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway\" --Huckleberry Finn \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e \u003e -- \"I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway\" --Huckleberry Finn",

Anyway, now I am here instead of \nher too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, \npossibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from\nRussia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for\nconsiderably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or \npay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all\nprogramming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content\nwriting, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may\naccept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and\ndevote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.\nAlternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more\nfeatures to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from\n$12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their\nspecialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.\nSo, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet \ndeadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant \nis online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also \ntheir company has local consultants in many states throughout the \nUSA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much,\nOksana Svetlova.\noksana@antee.comPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me \nknow a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.\n",

i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to thebank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the \" internet \" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : angel ann enterprises p . o . box 668292 charlotte , n . c . 28266-8292 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : m . l . m . 3069 alamo dr . suite 178 vacaville , ca . 95687-6344 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : c . e . e . p . o . box 5145 framingham , ma 01701-5145 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : m . j . k . p . o . box 30821 seattle , wa 98103-0821 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say \" no \" than \" yes \" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !

    "email": "_ rightward movement _ review - - i [ editor 's note : this is part one of a two part review . the second part appears in the next issue of linguist ] beerman , dorothee , david leblanc , \u0026 henk van riemsdijk , eds . ( 1997 ) rightward movement ( linguistik aktuell 17 ) amsterdam : benjamins . 406 pp . this is a proceedings volume collecting together papers presented in oct . 1995 at the tilburg conference on rightward movement . the editors mention two or three papers that were presented at the conference but were not including in this proceedings volume . i say ` two or three ' because , although they mention three authors ( kayne , koike , and truckenbrodt ) , koike actually has a paper in this volume ; i do not know why his name is included in the list of authors whose papers were not included . at the back of the book , a complete list of addresses ( snail - and e-mail ) of the contributors is included . the editors ' preface ( with van riemsdijk named as principal author ) provides a very nice summary of the relevant issues and their background in the literature . special note is taken of repercussions of recent work in minimalist program ( e . g . , kayne 1994 ) for the whole notion of ` rightward movement ' ( hereafter rm ) . this reviewer would note in particular that , although it is commonly supposed that , as stated in the preface , ` in a minimalist approach , movement is exclusively triggered by checking . . . . given this new line of thinking , rightward movement simply cannot be triggered , hence it cannot exist ' , some of the contributors - - e . g . , alphonce \u0026 davis , buring \u0026 hartmann - - demonstrate that it is in fact possible to develop hypotheses within the minimalist framework that would enable triggering of such movement . of the 14 papers in the collection , it is hardly surprising that 7 deal with ` extraposition ' ( defined in various ways ) , and four of those are concerned primarily with one aspect or other of extraposition in german . i will discuss these extraposition papers as a group before considering the others . josef bayer 's paper ` cp - extraposition as argument shift ' ( pp . 37-58 ) begins with a very nice , neat summary of problems with classical extraposition account ( via rm ) for postverbal cps in v - final languages ( focussing particularly on bengali , hindi , and german ) , noting that these problems disappear under a kayne - type analysis . however , he goes on to note definite empirical problems with a kayne - type analysis . he then proposes an analysis according to which a complement is right-adjoined to the maximal projection of its governing head ( in this case vp ) , leaving behind a trace as sole sister of that head ( v ) . if that trace is then deleted and the tree is pruned , the v ends up with a complement to its right which it can theta-mark . alternatively , bayer suggests , at least some ` extraposed ' cps may be base-generated to the right , co-indexed with a ( dummy / deletable ) pronominal , by inheritance from which they are licensed . bayer notes that this would help account for the fact that in some ov languages ( e . g . , bengali ) , certain classes of cps are * always * ` extraposed ' . if we assume that directionality is relevant to selection , then the resulting vp constitutes a barrier to a cp on the ` non-canonical ' side of the head , which would account for the scope effects bayer notes earlier as being problematic for both the traditional account and the kayne - type account . in ` rightward scrambling ' ( pp . 186-214 ) , anoop mahajan argues on the basis of various relations sensitive to c-command that postverbal nominal arguments in hindi are merely constituents left behind while everything else has moved leftwards . this analysis supersedes the rm analysis he proposed in an unpublished paper ten years ago and is deliberately consistent with an analysis based on kayne 's linear correspondence axiom ( hereafter lca ) . this reviewer notes that many of mahajan 's arguments necessarily presuppose certain possibly dubious tacit assumptions , e . g . , that rm must necessarily involve adjunction specifically to ip ( contrary to the approach proposed in , e . g . , muller 's , wiltschko 's , and rochemont \u0026 culicover 's papers ) . for instance , the string in mahajan 's ( 33 ) , which he marks ( ? ? ? ) could be generated - - and its unacceptability accounted for - - by right-adjunction of the direct object to vp rather than ip . nowhere does mahajan actually address what in this reviewer 's opinion is the most basic issue with questions like this : is there or is there not any evidence of a * gap * corresponding to the postverbal material ? michael s . rochemont \u0026 peter w . culicover in ` deriving dependent right adjuncts in english ' ( pp . 279-300 ) discuss various constructions in english , all of which might be included under a rather broadly-defined concept of ` extraposition ' . distinguishing between the extraposition of relative clauses on the one hand and heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion on the other , they argue that relative - clause extraposition is best treated as ( 1 ) base - generated and ( 2 ) right-adjunction to the governing category ( vp , ip , or cp ) of the antecedent to the extraposed rc . they make an effort to conjure up plausible analyses of rc - extraposition involving kayne - style leftward-movement but note that none of the possibilities they consider are quite satisfactory . even the ` best ' option , involving movement of both the rc and its antecedent to distinct spec positions , fails to provide any motivation for either the posited movement or the highly ramified structure such an analysis requires . expanding on earlier work of their own ( rochemont \u0026 culicover 1990 ) , rochemont \u0026 culicover argue that heavy - np shift and presentational - there insertion are best treated as instances of movement to a right - adjoined a ' - position . they demonstrate that , quite apart from the problems discussed in rochemont \u0026 culicover 1990 , any attempt to analyze such constructions by means of exclusively leftward movement involves the extremely unattractive movement of what is not , in fact , by any stretch of the imagination a recognizable constituent . in the end , they acknowledge that there are some empirical problems shared by both the rightward-movement account they apparently prefer and the ` movement to high specifier ' account that would be more consistent with a kayne - type approach , but that the latter raises some provoking theoretical problems that are absent from their rightward-movement account . they conclude by saying that ` the question whether rightward movement exists or not . . . is not an empirical one . ' daniel buring \u0026 katharina hartmann 's paper ` the kayne mutiny ' ( pp . 59-80 ) presents an excellent argument for the empirical bankruptcy of the kayne antisymmetry hypothesis . making crucial use of reconstruction at lf and of binding - theoretic statements referring to ( undeleted ) traces , b\u0026h 's argument is built upon the prediction that , if extraposition is a consequence of rm , it ought to be possible for a proper binding relation * not * to exist between an np and a cp later in the sentence - - if the np happens to be in a hierarchically lower position , from which neither it nor any of its daughters is able to c-command the cp ( such a lack of binding relation is a priori impossible in a kayne analysis , according to which any np to the left of a cp must ipso facto c-command it ) . they then demonstrate that such binding failures are in fact attested , and are indeed not all that difficult to come up with in a language like german . ( at the end of section 2 , they acknowledge some confusing results with regard to coreference options , concluding that these ` require further investigation ' . ) they further demonstrate ( section 3 ) that the kayne analysis actually does serious violence to many standard assumptions about movement , including ( similarly to rochemont \u0026 culicover ) issues of what qualifies as a ( movable ) constituent and under what circumstances a constituent may be ` stranded ' . ( it 's from this surreptitiously iconoclastic character of kayne 's hypothesis that they get their clever title . ) and they demonstrate that verb - topicalization ought to be impossible in a kayne analysis , although of course it 's quite common in german . in order to account for the complications with regard to island - constraint violations , etc . that have presented problems for earlier versions of a rm - analysis of extraposition in german and similar languages , b\u0026h propose ( p . 72 ) a generalization according to which finite clauses may never be governed by either v or i . this provides an actual motivation for cp - extraposition , since presumably in its ds position a complement clause is governed by the matrix verb , and in order to escape that government must be right-adjoined to some higher phrasal node , presumably ip . this is in direct conflict with bayer 's analysis , according to which the extraposed cp ends up being governed by the matrix verb as a result of the deletion of its own trace and tree-pruning ; which analysis is to be preferred ought to be an empirical problem . hubert haider 's paper ` extraposition ' ( 115-152 ) argues on the basis of the extraposition of comparatives and the c-command relations essential thereto in english and german ( mostly german ) that extraposed constituents remain embedded in their ds mothers . haider further argues that extraposed relative and argument clauses must also be vp - internal , since although they are n't subject to the same c-command relations themselves , they always come * before * extraposed comparatives which are . broadening his scope in section 2 to other examples of german extraposition , haider demonstrates that they can't result from movement and must therefore be base-generated . but , on the basis of scope , c-command , and absence of island-effects , he also argues against an analysis in terms of base-generated adjunction . haider agrees with kayne in assuming exclusive leftward movement ; however , he allows for either head-initial or head-final base structures , and invokes head movement while kayne invokes phrasal movement . haider presents several predictions that kayne 's lca theory would have for a language such as german , which he then demonstrates are all falsified by the actual data : ( 1 ) phrases to the left of the verb should be in spec - positions , and should therefore be islands ( 2 ) vp - adverbials and predicates should end up in postverbal position , since there 's nothing to trigger their movement ( 3 ) vp - topicalization ought to involve the movement of a functional projection containing a trace of the finite verb . in ` extraposition as remnant movement ' ( p . 215-246 ) , gereon muller offers a very neat analysis of extraposition in german as right - adjunction to a variety of phrasal nodes , including cp as well as vp or ip , thereby accounting for various otherwise problematic details with regard to island effects in both leftward - and rightward-moved constituents . the paper includes a very interesting and useful comparative discussion of the adequacy of a variety of different proposed constraints for excluding unacceptable strings while allowing acceptable ones . martina wiltschko 's paper , ` extraposition , identification and precedence ' ( pp . 358-396 ) , a summary of her 1995 wien dissertation , discusses extraposition in german , focussing on the relation of * identification * between the ` identifyee ' , the ( pro ) nominal element ( np or dp ) in the canonical position within the clause and the ` identifier ' , the extraposed constituent . both identifyee and identifier provide linguistically necessary information : the identifyee occupies a canonical ( theta - ) position , therefore satisfying syntactic requirements , while the identifier provides necessary semantic content to licence the identifyee 's definiteness . given that the identifyee * introduces * a discourse referent , it must ( on the basis of heim 's ( 1980 ) novelty condition ) precede the identifier . wiltschko also argues for a locality constraint on identification , according to which the identifier must c-command the identifyee , without any intervening xp ; thus , the identifier must be right-adjoined to the minimal maximal projection dominating the identifyee . in wiltschko 's view , these two constraints together account for the fact that identifiers are always extraposed . she acknowledges that this analysis apply only to * restrictive relative clauses * , not to other types of modifiers . attractive as the paper is in many ways , it suffers somewhat from the necessary exclusion of many supporting arguments , for which the interested reader is referred to the full-length dissertation . two of the papers are concerned primarily with parsing theory and the development of adequate parsing technology . both of these papers , coming from different points of view , argue for a data-driven , bottom-up parsing strategy as against a hypothesis-driven top-down strategy . in ` on movement and one - pass no backtrack parsing ' ( pp . 301-330 ) , chris sijtsma recognizes that ` natural ' ( i . e . , single-pass , no backtracking , faithful to derivation ) bottom-up parsers are less restrictive than natural top-down parsers , which of course from the point of view of strict generative theory is a point against them , but assumes that there is enough variation among actual languages that a bottom-up parsing strategy is to be preferred . this reviewer finds such a conclusion attractive , but worries that sijtsma has provided so little in the way of empirical demonstration to back it up ; indeed , for such a mathematically-oriented paper ( at least relative to this reviewer 's experience ) , there is extremely little in the way of solid argument presented ; most of the time , sijtsma merely asserts that the proof of any given theorem is either self-evident or readily derivable ; in a few cases , he refers to demonstrations elsewhere in the literature . another issue both of these papers consider very seriously , without , however , either of them coming up with a very satisfactory solution , is the proper size of the look - ahead window for an adequate parser . sijtsma asserts ( pp . 305 - 6 ) that any grammar with a look-ahead window greater than 1 is functionally equivalent to a grammar that looks ahead just one symbol , but then goes on to say , ` in practice we still need . . . parsers that look ahead more than one symbol . ' in subsequent discussion it becomes clear that he is unclear just how large a look - ahead window is empirically adequate . likewise , alphonce \u0026 davis , while currently working with a look-ahead window of ` at most two chunks ' ( p . 25 ) , are clearly dissatisfied with this characterization . it is clear that this issue needs more thought , if not further research , devoted to it . a fundamental claim of the paper by carl alphonce \u0026 henry davis , ` motivating non - directional movement ' ( pp . 7-36 ) , is that linear precedence constraints , indeed lp phenomena of any kind , have no relevance for syntax at all ; essentially , they claim that , from the point of view of all syntactic levels including lf , constituents are organized hierarchically in terms of dominance relations but not linearly in terms of precedence relations . in alphonce \u0026 davis ' view , all precedence relations are imposed at pf , making them essentially matters of performance rather than competence . in the opinion of this reviewer , this is a very interesting and possibly attractive idea . unfortunately , contrary to the promise contained in the abstract , this claim is not so much argued for as assumed within the paper . nor is it made clear - - to this reviewer , anyway - - that it is explicitly argued for anywhere else , unlike the skipped arguments behind wiltschko 's paper and the citations given in sijtsma 's paper . alphonce \u0026 davis merely demonstrate that it is possible to develop an analytic approach - - more precisely , a parsing program - - that has no need for any kind of explicit syntactic constraints , at any level ( whether ug or language-particular ) , making reference to linear order . at the end of their abstract , alphonce \u0026 davis claim that they are motivated by a conviction that ` it is a priori desirable to eliminate as much redundancy as possible between different components of the system . . . . if some phenomena has [ sic ] an independent processing explanation we hold that syntactic theory should not have to offer any explanation for it . ' this approach is all very well in a purely formal mathematical system , but it is fairly common knowledge that redundancy is in fact a sine qua non of biological systems ( cf . e . g . gould 1993 ) and of natural-linguistic systems as well ( cf . e . g . hock 1986 , ch . 9 \u0026 12 ; this fact is also acknowledged by chris sijtsma in his paper , p . 314 ) . the mere fact that one can develop a parsing program that has no need to appeal to syntactic lp constraints , therefore , in no way demonstrates that such constraints have no place in human natural-language competence . much of sijtsma 's paper is devoted to developing points ( regarding , e . g . , the proper type ( s ) and subcategorization frame ( s ) of pps ) that are clearly relevant to his primary concern , which is developing an adequate automated parsing grammar , but are tangential to the focus of the collection . in arguing , contrary to kayne , that ug does not stipulate one universal tree-structure for all languages , sijtsma gets a fair amount of mileage out of replacing the assumption that node-labels are atomic with the assumption that they are merely shorthand for feature-bundles . though he does n't mention this , this replacement has actually been implicit in x - bar theory ever since the early 70 's . with regard to directionality of movement , sijtsma argues that rightward movement must be allowed by ug , with this caveat : in deriving ss from ds , leftward movement is unrestricted but rightward movement of modifiers ( which do n't leave obvious gaps ) should not exceed the look-ahead buffer ; on the other hand , in deriving lf from ss rightward movement is unrestricted but leftward [ editor 's note : this review is continued in the next issue of linguist ] - steven schaufele , ph . d . , asst . prof . of linguistics , english department soochow university , waishuanghsi campus , taipei 11102 , taiwan , roc ( 886 ) ( 02 ) 2881-9471 ext . 6504 fcosw5 @ mbm1 . scu . edu . tw http : / / www . prairienet . org / ~ fcosws / homepage . html * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",

    "email": "URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html\nDate: Not suppliedFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *\"Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information \nfrom the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.\"* There are a \ncouple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in \none batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle \nof the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will \nback out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error \nmessages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can \nfail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages \nafter they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we \nprompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup \nScreenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be \npredicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might \nnot conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of \nWindows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha \ndidn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away \nso they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the \nlong install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if \nyou force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part \nof the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left \ntheir system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account \nin case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of \nthe wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to \nupgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a \nreboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been \nkeeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So \npart one of the batch is \"Stop IIS.\" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it \nwould be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I \ndon't need to write the code for \"Start IIS\" for the end of the batch. So the \ncode to rollback \"Stop IIS\" is already written. No big deal, I just need to \ncall it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should \"gather all the info and then \ndo all the work\" is because with very large installation programs that are very \nslow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even \nFogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the \"create account\" \noperation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of \nthe work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for \nIIS to stop and start. *\"Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself \nhas admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.\"* First of all, leave \nyour language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed \nto figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious \narguments are unbelievably boring.  Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, \nsince I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And \nI don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really \nwell_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would \ndefinitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), \ncertainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do \nin this setup program are things like \"grant the Logon as Service privilege to \nan account.\" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this \nis to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you \nsearch the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you \nfind is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I \nknow, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated \nDelphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that \ncosts as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more \nproductive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the \ncode I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library \nI've been using for years to make wizards. *\"Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup \nprograms don't increase sales.\"* This was actually the smartest question and \nmade me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the \nlife of the code. \n- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want \nthem to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate \nbecause they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of \nSpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the \nnew version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another \nmorning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all \nthe little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and \nGoogle Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it \nsuspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's \ntoo much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have \nlost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. \n- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of \nstandardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and \noranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a \nmeaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, \nmainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing \nsoftware. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is \nguaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it \nand say \"Aha!\"\n*\"How can we make WISE[4] better?\" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE \nInstallation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the \nreasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html\n[2] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\n[3] http://discuss.fogcreek.com/delphiquestions\n[4] http://www.wise.com\n",

I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. \nAfter a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- \nand I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!\" \n-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA \"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher \nlevel of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision \nwere enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and \nit seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill \nat the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and \na change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, \nI only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra \nkarate workout just to expend all the extra energy!\" \"After 6 months on \nGH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has \nincreased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!\" \n-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA \"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute \nand a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where \nI could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again \nafter only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!\" \n-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA \"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print.\" \n-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA \"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. \nI have been under great stress in my business. \nI believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping \nmy energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst \nof discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. \nColds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. \nMy muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy \nwhen I go out walking.\" \n- Carolyn Munn \"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that \nI try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed \na doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging \nFormula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. \nThank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!\" \n-Rita Mills McCoy \"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, \nin my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels \ndropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging \nFormula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal \ncoloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this \nwithout having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking \nfew sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! \n-Alan Ross, 43 years old GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 \navailable on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH.  \n WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)? Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which \nis secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the \nendocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically \nsimilar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few \nhours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones \nsecreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout \nthe body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. \nThe body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously \ndying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original \ncells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to \nstore memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability \nto learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. \nWhen growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the \nall-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance \nwhich is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the \nproper dosage amounts. GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, \nmelatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny \nchemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate \nthe activities of the vital organs. The word \"hormone\" is derived from a Greek word \nmeaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the \neffects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other \nhormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly \nreverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including \nmaking the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also \nhelps restore hair color and hair loss. \n \nTHE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH? Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production \ngradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per \ndecade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, \nits availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians \nhave been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. \nUnfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical \nprofession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been \nthat the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only \neffective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by \nAnti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. \n \nGH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61  \nGrowth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. \nThe amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. \nThis results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age \nof 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, \n200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages \nof 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, \nor Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called \naging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. \nHealing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. \nThose who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include \nan effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.\n After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined \nafter 6 or more months of GH therapy:  _ Improved memory \n_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs \n_ Increased sexual drive and performance \n_ Increased fertility \n_ Enhanced immune system \n_ Quicker wound and fracture healing \n_ New hair growth and color reparation \n_ Sharper vision \n_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance \n_ Increased muscle mass without exercise \n_ Reduction of cellulite and fat \n_ Increased stamina and vitality \n_ Reduction in high blood pressure \n_ Improvement in sleep \n_ Anti-aging \n_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing \n_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol \n_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol \n_ Strengthening of bones \n  IS GH SAFE? \n \nGH has been successfully used in the medical community \nfor over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. \nEdmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over \n800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that \nGH had substantial benefits and no side effects.\n \n *********************************************************************** \nYou're going to receive Anti-Aging Formula for under $150.00... \nNot even $50.00...

    "email": "summary of names of days dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of \" today \" . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of \" today \" , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , \" the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . \" ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from \" today \" is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : \" if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? \" the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have \" lexicalised \" ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . \" that / yonder day \" ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . \" other day \" ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian \" tomorrow \" is ' utre ' . but \" the day after tomorrow \" is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . \" on ( the ) other day \" , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian \" the day before yesterday \" , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - \" that day \" . no preposition ' v ' ( \" on \" ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - \" i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday \" . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( \" each - acc week - acc \" ) , which means \" every week \" in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for \" the day before the day before yesterday \" - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( \" on the day before the day before yesterday \" ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( \" two days ago \" , lit . \" before two days \" ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( \" on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow \" ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( \" in / after two days \" ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to \" add on \" to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of \" today \" : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + \" today \" side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this \" imbalance \" is \" balanced \" again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of \" today \" , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between \" before today \" and \" after today \" is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09",

' s plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign tuesday as the energy giant ' s chief executive officer after only about six months in the job . in an interview yesterday , the 47 - year - old mr . skilling elaborated on his decision to leave houston - based enron . on tuesday , mr . skilling insisted he had resigned for \" personal reasons \" unrelated to enron ' s business activities . in the interview , he reiterated that he wasn ' t under any pressure to resign from the company ' s board or chairman kenneth lay , who has resumed the ceo ' s duties at the nation ' s biggest energy trader . however , yesterday mr . skilling said that his \" personal reasons \" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as ceo . calling the company ' s stock performance a \" kind of ultimate score card , \" mr . skilling noted that enron ' s share price had fallen by some 50 % this year . mr . skilling said he took that stock - price drop very personally . \" i put a lot of pressure on myself \" for that decline , he said . \" i felt i must not be communicating well enough \" with investors . he felt this particularly given enron ' s strong financial results over the past several quarters , based largely on growing volumes in its trading business , which covers a range of items , including electricity , pulp and paper . if the stock price had remained up \" i don ' t think i would have felt the pressure to leave , \" he said . in january , enron topped $ 84 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading . it closed tuesday , before the announcement of mr . skilling ' s resignation , at $ 42 . 93 a share . as of 4 p . m . yesterday , enron traded at $ 40 . 25 , after falling below $ 37 during the day . mr . skilling , who had been at enron 11 years , said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow enron employees , many of whom are shareholders . \" people would say ` what is going on with the stock , jeff ? ' i would have to say i didn ' t know . it has been frustrating , \" said mr . skilling . the self - portrait offered by mr . skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious , bright and thick - skinned business strategist whose long - held goal had been becoming enron ceo . mr . skilling said that the \" final straw \" in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to england in connection with the deaths of three enron workers in a power - plant accident there . that trip helped reinforce \" how tenuous life is , \" said mr . skilling , who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged . while mr . skilling said enron is in \" great shape , \" his departure raised anxiety in the investment community . merrill lynch , for instance , lowered its rating on enron to neutral from buy based on \" uncertainty \" created by the resignation . yesterday , an enron spokesman confirmed that mr . lay plans to name two executives to the existing \" office of the chairman \" within the next few days or weeks . the spokesman said mr . lay hadn ' t yet revealed whom the two would be . the office of the chairman had consisted of mr . lay and mr . skilling . copyright ? 2000 dow jones \u0026 company , inc . all rights reserved .",

Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.\n\u003e There's nothing we can do,\" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make\n\u003e themselves more beautiful.\"\n\u003e -- \n\"I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway\" --Huckleberry Finn\n",

You're supposed to just shut up and take it.\"http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/===========Who's the real monster?\nIt seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that\ndares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\nway.Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's\nperception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how\nthey feel about this foolishness.\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - DiscussDave deflects what he can't take the time to understand\nIt's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\nand looking like fools.What Dave does is just the opposite.Posts a link to something he doesn't understand\nGet's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\nDerides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.\nExpects others to do research for him\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\nRealizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be\ntrue.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\ntrying.One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It's like that movie The\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about\nyou but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\nThe ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.\"Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\naround.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\ngood ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing\nall the trouble.We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking\namongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.\nThat's where we're coming from.If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an\ne-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally\nimpossible:His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\nIt would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\ndeal-stoppers.Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\nit!The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\ngetting rejected!Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\n'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be\nnice to him because he's still recovering?Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\nfights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\nDave is Scary on 9/11Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\nI'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\n9-11.\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\nsomeone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\nWow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:The man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining\nbuffoonGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!Related links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"Dave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\nReferral log funnies\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\nto patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial\u0026entry=78025336This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\nThere's no way to route around them. 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\nWhen's a Permalink not a Permalink?\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\npermanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a\ndefinition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!\n 9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss",

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb . ' 04 additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release estimated shares in float : 7 million completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26 record backlog of sales for leth : during the past year , over 20 additional biosphere process systems have been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over $ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million per biosphere process system ! leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system : leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . iqrf gisvhq jyip m wcgjlusxi m j ngyl jlri oiyg",

2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to \" try before you buy \" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum",

' translation into the second language ' is firmly grounded in empirical research , and in this regard it serves as a stimulus and a methodological guide for further research . it will be a valuable addition for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of applied linguistics , translation theory , bilingualism and second language acquisition as well as those involved in teaching or practising translation at a professional level . stuart campbell associate professor in language studies , and director of the language acquisition research centre at the university of western sydney macarthur . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices available for review",

Please see the bottom of this\nmessage for further information and removal instructions.\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN\nHIS CLOSET!Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old\nwoman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my\nhusband earns in a year\".The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \n\"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever\n15-year-old.The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\nthe top of the list.The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and\nreally did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".  Over\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"  The\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\ncloset, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \nfifties and hundreds.\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\nbank down the street (laughs).\"  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\n\"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee.[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What \nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you\nsay \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\n\"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\".\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY \u0026 RESPECT THIS\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\nTHAN EVER.\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.This is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\".Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time \nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\nanything.\" More testimonials later but first,PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME \u0026 NUMBER OF THE \nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE\nSURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT\n CORNER in case of any mail problems. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from\nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be\naccessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from\nyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\nsomething happens to your computer.\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next\nto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is\ninstructed below in step \"1 through 6\" or you will loose out on majority of\nyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see\nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.\nBut it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy\nand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than\nwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,\nhonesty reaps the reward!!!\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and\nREMOVE the name \u0026 address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\n2.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.\n3.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.\n4.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.\n5.... Move the name \u0026 address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2\n6.... Insert YOUR name \u0026 address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name \u0026 address ACCURATELY!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on\nyour computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:\n1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......\nGrand Total=$555,550.00\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL \u0026 PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\nmailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on \nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just\nthat, and more!\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\nFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\neasily get a larger response.\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as\nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\nReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all\norders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER \u0026 NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\nthe NUMBER \u0026 the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nREPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the NetOrder Report #1 from:\nR.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until\nyou do.+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will\ncontinue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different\nreport. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START\nTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you\ncan generate from this business!!!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS\nPROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few\nweeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works\nexceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your\nname and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customers\nyou will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, \nmaterials and opportunity to become financially independent. \nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW!++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n\"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\npopulation and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n\"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on\nme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45\ndays she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.\nI have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back\". \"I was\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big\".Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\nelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete\nthis one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money\ncame within 22 weeks\".Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Office\nof Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington,D.C.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This email was sent to you via Saf-E Mail Systems.

Abolins\" Subject: Aussie paper: US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spiesAnybody ever heard of Pavlik Morozov? (If not see http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/morozov.html for a quick blurb about the fellow.) When I see proposals to mobilize American people into being eyes and ears fo the government, I am reminded of Pavilik and his family.Now I am not against people reporting certain things to the police. It is the habit of being constantly suspicious of neighbors, co-workers, and otehrs that can become destructive. Down the line it can lead to suspicions based not on significant clues but upon things such as \"fails to display sufficient respect for authority\", \"laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland security' is used\", and \"hangs out with anti-social misfits.\" It is an all too easy slide from neighbors watching out for each and helping the community to becoming agents of the state.J.D. AbolinsPS: Why is it that the most revealing news reports about the USA are coming nowadays form the UK, Aussie, and other non-USA media? -------------- From the Sydney Morning Herald Web site 15 July 2002 http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/14/1026185141232.htmlUS planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies By Ritt Goldstein July 15 2002The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report \"suspicious activity\".Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale investigations of US citizens.As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the 10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.[...] ------------------------------------------------------------------------- POLITECH -- Declan McCullagh's politics and technology mailing list You may redistribute this message freely if you include this notice.

Elegant.==http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.htmlAs mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat\nwhen it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective\nmethods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to\nresolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you\nalready have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used.What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get\nrid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with\nthe IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the\nlisted domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this\ncase is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If\nyou choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out\nlinks. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows\ndirectory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you\ndo. The hosts file is called \"hosts\" there is no extension. You may have a\nfile named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your\ncomputer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at\nthe contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as\nan address for getting updated versions. Because we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on\na mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system\ninstructions.\ndownload now \nWe didn't write this file and do not provide support for it's use. Follow\nthe address in the hosts file for questions. It's not that we don't want to\nhear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

That's my understanding of how it works anyway. \u003e \u003e John \u003e \u003e Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore: export CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=\" \u0026\u0026 CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.Cheers, John Gay-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

' we would like to organize the papers under the following headings : 1 . aspects of language systems 2 . creolization as language acquisition 3 . bilingualism half - to one page abstracts should be submitted by e-mail to anette nielsen ( vixen @ ling . aau . dk ) by november 1st . 1998 .

    "email": "mt special issue on slt : reminder reminder - - deadline is july 1 1998 call for submissions machine translation special issue on spoken language translation guest editor : steven krauwer ( utrecht university ) guest editorial board : doug arnold ( university of essex ) pascale fung ( hkust , hong kong ) walter kasper ( dfki , saarbrucken ) alon lavie ( cmu , pittsburgh ) lori levin ( cmu , pittsburgh ) hermann ney ( rwth , aachen ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) some 15 years ago , when machine translation had become fashionable again in europe , few people would be prepared to consider seriously embarking upon spoken language translation research . after all , where both machine translation of written text , and speech understanding and production ( despite important achievements ) were still quite far from showing robustness in domain-independent applications , it seemed clear that putting three not even halfway understood technologies together would be premature , and bound to fail . since then , the world has changed . many researchers , both in academia and in industry , have taken up the challenge to build systems capable of translating spoken language . does that mean that most of the problems involved in speech-to - text , text-to - text translation , and text-to - speech have been solved ? the answer is no : although we have made a tremendous progress , both from a scientific and from a technological point of view , many of the fundamental problems in mt and in speech understanding remain unsolved . yet a certain degree of optimism is justified here . first of all , it is clear that on the whole general expectations of what mt will do are changing . where in the past the ultimate goal of mt seemed to be to provide a perfect , but cheaper and faster alternative to the human translator , there is now a clear shift from the ideal of fully automated high quality translation of unrestricted texts to the more practical problem of overcoming the language barriers we encounter in various situations . this shift of focus allows us to partition the problem we address into a series of smaller ones , the solution to which may be within our reach . this applies both to spoken and written language translation . if we look at spoken communication between human beings with different native languages , very often the main success criterion for this communication is not whether or not the individual utterances produced by the participants have been expressed or understood without errors ( which will rarely be the case ) , but rather whether the intended goal of the communication has been attained ( hotel room reservation , airline information , etc ) . this observation is extremely important when we try to set our goals for spoken translation systems . once we have realized that communication takes place in a specific context , with a specific goal , and have accepted that sentence-by - sentence linguistically correct translation is not a necessary condition for successful multilingual communication , we can start exploiting the full potential of spoken dialogues in human-human and human-machine interaction : the basic structure of dialogues , the ways to control dialogue flow , the possibility for repair . a workshop dedicated to spoken language translation , organized in conjunction with eacl / acl 1997 in madrid , showed that there was a keen interest in the topic , and that many acedemic and industrial research teams have interesting results to report . therefore we feel that the time has come to dedicate a special issue of the journal machine translation to this topic , and we are inviting high-quality , previously unpublished research papers addressing problems in the whole field of spoken language translation . ( note : authors who had papers accepted for the madrid workshop are especially encouraged to submit papers which have developed out of their workshop contributions , though they should note that we do not intend simply to reprint the workshop papers in their original form . ) we are especially interested in papers addressing problems or solutions that are typical for spoken language translation ( as opposed to written language translation ) . format for submission : please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header \" submission to coat speech special issue \" , or in hard-copy to either of the following addresses : machine translation editorial office , machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 , p . o . box 230 3300 az dordrecht , accord , ma 02018-023 the netherlands u . s . a . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor steven . krauwer @ let . ruu . nl or in hard-copy to steven krauwer , utrecht institute of linguistics ots , trans 10 , 3512 jk utrecht , the netherlands submission deadline : submissions and abstracts should be received by july 1 1998 . papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the editorial board . we are aiming for publication as issue 3 or 4 of volume 13 ( autumn or winter , 1998 ) .",

    "email": "more on nlp to the readers : i have recently sent out several email inquiries to various list services that i subscribe to in an attempt to learn why we do not see more software that can relate to the complexities of human grammar . that is , i was trying to learn why do n't we see better grammar checkers , more translation software , and more sophisticated language tutoring software . if there were a theory of syntax that could be programmed at all would n't there also be a swarm of programs being offered by researchers and graduate students from around the world ? would n't we be arguing about the merits of \" lfg - linguist 3 . 1 \" vs \" gb - linguist 2 . 0 . \" and would n't we be arguing about the merits of one theories labelled bracketing versus another 's ? further , other areas that might use language interfaces such as games and program internal \" help facilities \" are also quite primitive . granted , the difficulties of trying to get a program to account for pro - - blems of meaning have occupied programmers for years , but this in itself is not sufficient enough explanation for why we do not see more results in areas that require a program to exhibit a sophisticated understanding of the structure of human language . which brings me to the point of this query . to improve my understanding of this problem and perhaps to generate some meaningful dialog about this problem , i would like to propose the following list of what we should minimally expect of a program or a theory of syntax that claims to be able to handle the structure of human language . i would like to invite readers to add to the list or to point out which areas have already been adequately handled . if an area is adequately handled , i would like information on how to receive the software that is available . i divide this list into three basic areas : 1 ) minimum requirements for linguists , 2 ) minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax , and 3 ) minimum requirements for translation technology . i . minimum requirements for linguists . a program or a theory of syntax that is to be programmed must minimally be able to : 1 ) provide a full labelled bracketing of any string ( including information about intermediate and maximal level nodes ) . 2 ) provide the parts of speech of all items in a string 3 ) provide the parts of a sentence ( subject , direct object , etc ) of a string 4 ) provide acceptability judgements for sentences that can be parsed ( e . g . john1 likes himself2 is parsable but unacceptable ) . 5 ) provide judgements about topicalized sentences , fronted wh questions , tough - movement sentences , relative clauses , noun clauses , cleft and pseudo - cleft sentences , pied - piping , the complex np constraint , control sentences , parasitic gap sentences , island conditions , the that trace effect , the coreferrence requirements of pronouns and reciprocals , and strong and weak crossover effects . 6 ) perhaps provide explanations for why particular parses fail . ii . minimum requirements for grammar checkers , foreign language tutoring software , and other more secular uses of syntax . a program or theory of syntax that is to be of value in these areas should minimally : 1 ) provide information about part of speech 2 ) provide information about part of sentence ( subject , object , etc ) 3 ) provide demonstrations of grammatical constructions e . g . make passivesentences from active and active from passive , make questions from statements , join two sentences into one using a variety of conjunctions , transitions and prepositions . 4 ) provide judgements about errors in the production of sentences 5 ) provide information about types of clauses : subordinate / main , adverb , noun etc . 6 ) provide information about sentence type e . g . simple , complex , compound , etc . 7 ) analyze punctuation of words , phrases , and clauses ( including coordination ) . minimum requirements for translation technology : 1 ) provide a correct parse for the subject language and provide a grammatically correct sentence in the target language . 2 ) provide acceptability judgements and other grammar checking of sentences in both languages . 3 ) be able to do convert some sentences in both languages : e . g . statement to question , active to passive and so on . this list might be short in many ways , but i think it illustrates my point . there is a lot more that could be happening in the realm of computational syntax , but it is not happening . if i am overly pessimistic , i would like to know where i can find software that can do the above . i will post all responses to the list as a summary . also , if anyone would like to add to this list , i will keep track of the responses and post them to the list . also , if someone can explain what prevents these developments i would appreciate that as well . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaii . edu",

None of this would explain why the signatures for sample-spam.txt from spamassassin is registered on honor but not apt or fire.-----Original Message----- From: Rose, Bobby Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 9:54 AM To: mail@vipul.net; razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: RE: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Thanks that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to \"ac-100\" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

    "email": "new uci dissertations in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following two uci dissertations in linguistics . feature attraction and category movement brian k . agbayani university of california , irvine , 1998 this dissertation presents a new theory of movement in generative grammar within the framework of the minimalist program ( chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) . the most important aspect of the new theory is that it departs from the standard view of move a as a unitary operation . the dissertation has three main goals . the first goal is to simplify the theory of feature checking in such a way that a single structural configuration ( namely , the head-adjunction structure ) holds for feature checking in both overt and covert syntax . the second goal is to present evidence for the split movement hypothesis , according to which a set of formal features and its associated category move to separate structural positions in syntax . the claim is that ug makes both attract and move available in the form of attract f and category movement , respectively . the former satisfies the formal requirement of feature checking , and the latter yields the phonological \" displacement \" effect of overt movement . the theory thus abandons the treatment of move a as a unitary operation . the third goal is to explore consequences for the proper characterization of locality in syntax . the split movement approach opens up a novel way to account for the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects ( huang 1982a ) that do not fall under chomsky 's ( 1995 ) attract f theory . it is argued that attract f and category movement are subject to different types of economy conditions , and that the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effects should not be given a unified account , contrary to the barriers approach ( chomsky 1986a ) . the theory also derives a number of previously mysterious properties related to cross linguistic variation in extractability out of islands , the relative strength of island effects , and the nature of successive-cyclic movement . this dissertation presents a new approach to movement in syntax which overcomes the conceptual and empirical shortcomings of the traditional approach , while gaining new insights into previously mysterious phenomena and properties of natural languages . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : parametrization of features in syntax sze - wing tang university of california , irvine , 1998 the major focus of this study is to propose a restrictive theory of parameters of universal grammar in terms of the principles-and - parameters approach . i propose that semantic features are invariant across languages ; only features that may play a role in the derivation from n to the pf interface level including phonetic features , categorial features , and affix features are subject to parametric variation , which is called the ' overt parametrization hypothesis ' ( oph ) . it is argued that where affix features are associated with a word is subject to parametric variation . movement is largely determined by morphology : movement in the overt component can be signaled by ' impoverished ' morphology ; movement of morphologically ' rich ' elements takes place in the phonological component . under this approach , a variety of syntactic differences among chinese ( cantonese and mandarin ) , english , french , japanese , navajo , and hebrew can be accounted for . based on the idea of parametrization of affix features , i claim that t has an affix feature [ - v ] in english . such an affix feature is missing in chinese . consequently , there is no v - to - t movement in chinese and v moves out of vp in english . a number of apparently disparate differences between these two languages , including postverbal no-phrases , the distribution of focus elements , binominal each , the ' sov ' focalization construction , scopal ambiguity of quantifiers , definiteness of preverbal numeral phrases , gapping , and heavy np shift , receive a unified explanation . the data presented as evidence for the claim that categorial features are subject to parametric variation are primarily based on small clauses in chinese , english , and japanese . it is argued that chinese small clauses are bare , english small clauses are ' not-so - bare ' , and japanese allows both types of small clauses . the major typological differences among these languages regarding the structure of small clauses are derived from a parameter related to the combination of categorial features of nouns and adjectives . the findings lend support to the oph . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : also available : \u003e uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement ikawa , hajime 1996 overt movement as a reflex of morphology ishii , toru 1997 an asymmetry in the composition of phrase structure and its consequences li , xiaoguang 1997 deriving distributivity in mandarin chinese takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of \u0026p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther \u003e chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : \" partial \" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the \" crossing \" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : scrambling and partial object shift kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south \u003e western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani \u003e and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling \u003e uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , \u003e kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 4 ;

Just saying \"crucial hair feature\" \nimproves my day immeasurably.I've done a fair amount of thinking about the \"media intermediated\" meeting \nthing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   \nOne is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.\nSome people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for \ngetting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much \nimproved at being able to spot \"interesting\" at a distance.   Interesting \nisn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so \noften.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, \nbut that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of \ncreative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any \nkind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was \nworking on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of \nthe candidates was \"women, in order of attractiveness.\"   I flinched from \nthat, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to \ntalk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a \nparty.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if \non the net all you have is a photo.....You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's \nnot how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.\n(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)\nIt's too easy to say \"Oh, no!  He's a geek!\"   or \"She's a CAT person, \nick!\" when you might have a great time together.We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as \npeople, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on \ntasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing \nbut superstitious association unless you actually have time in the \nperson's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of \nexposure shrinks after school.Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet \u0026 email thing ought to \nwork better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it \ndoesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the \nsame poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating\nSpeed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in \nthe company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think \nit's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a \nproject together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.\nIt was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young \npeople to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much \"interview\" context \nand no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort \nthough. I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for \nyou means that the traditional advice of \"join activities groups\" is \nactually sound.Eirikur\n",

    "email": "california update 1 / 31 / 01 please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) with additional questions . executive summary an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of long - term contracts ( price and term ) . the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan to 1 ) pass on \" court ordered rate increases \" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds . audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of \" endless appeals \" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well as to limit the scope of the rate hikes . davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy . davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state . legislation and bail out bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure , specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign . bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power . according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes . a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the \" baseline \" is set at 60 % of average consumption ) , but it is \" progressive \" in a politically important sense . making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when pg \u0026 e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates . the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by californians to use less electricity . \" every time you think there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves , something like this happens , \" one legislator moaned . long - term contracts a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . \" we got a series of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , \" one official told our source . \" the idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say , ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy . \" bankruptcy because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for socal edison and pg \u0026 e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) . we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis . audit results and ballot initiatives markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debt - issuing binge . the audit of pg \u0026 e released late last night was even more damaging : pg \u0026 e management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to \" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis \" by not making deep spending cuts , \" including scaling back management salaries . \" the auditors also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company , which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks . \" basically , they took the money and ran , \" as state senate speaker burton put it yesterday . what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely difficult . keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate . court battle thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg \u0026 e are likely to win in mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7 billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt . pg \u0026 e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996 deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid so - called \" stranded costs , \" they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power . although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand , political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices ( \" the courts made me do it \" ) , but on the other hand , they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout . \" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily . \" one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps even the year after . \" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think the creditors will be quite that patient . \"",

    "email": "logic and natural language semantics esslli-99 workshop : foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics call for papers the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its first week it will feature a worskshop on foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the following issues . intensional logic lies at the heart of a montague - style natural language semantics . it involves a representation of properties , relations and propositions ( prps ) . in traditional montague grammar , prps are characterized in terms of possible worlds , and the logico-semantic paradoxes are avoided by using a russellian hierarchy of types . the problems with this traditional approach ( e . g . , logical omniscience and expressive limitations ) have led to the flourishing of more fine - grained notions of prp , and to type-free solutions to the paradoxes ( gupta and belnap , barwise and etchemendy , cocchiarella , bealer , asher and kamp , chierchia and turner , etc . ) . the new approaches have problems of their own and no new framework has become standard . this workshop thus will explore and compare well - known or newly proposed foundational approaches for an intensional logic that can serve the purposes of natural language semantics . if you are interested in presenting your research , please send a two page abstract to : francesco orilia orilia @ unimc . it dipartimento di filosofia e scienze umane ph . + 39 ( 0733 ) 258 305 universit = e0 di macerata fax + 39 ( 0733 ) 235 339 62100 macerata italy the submission deadline is : march 15 , 1999 . workshop speakers will pay a reduced essli-99 registration fee , which will entitle them to attend all other courses and workshops . it may be possible to allocate a sum of about 100 ecu to partially cover the expenses of each workshop speaker . there will soon be an esslli ' 99 web page at : http : / / esslli . let . uu . nl / .",

    "email": "snow 3 1 / 2 dear linguists , i ' ve been following the discussion about snowy words here and elsewhere for some time now , and i can't but disagree with douglas j . glick ( see vol-5 - 1322 ) in two points . for one , i do n't find the discussion \" relatively uninteresting \" . it is interesting indeed to see what kind of ideas about the issue as such and linguistics in general tonguesters ( or is l . more p . c . ? : - ) put forward . it so happened that i encountered this nice passage in a book i bought a few days ago : whereas english [ . . . ] has only one word for _ snow _ ( or two if we include _ sleet _ ) , eskimo has several . trudgill ( 1974 ) : 27 this is a book written for the general audience , by a native speaker of english , who \" has been a lecturer in the department of linguistic science at the university of reading since 1970 \" ( op . cit . ) , and it is twenty years old . but you sometimes still hear assertions like the above , and i know the same thing from german speakers . still , in german we have at least schnee , schnee ( - mann , - regen , matsch ) , ( schnee ) flocke , neuschnee , harsch , waechte , lawine , loipe , hagel , graupel , and for english , snow , snow ( bank , fort , house , man , - mixed-with - rain , - flake , - storm ) , slush ( snow ) , ( snow ) cornice , avalanche , blizzard , dusting , flurry , frost , hail , hardpack , igloo , pingo , powder , sleet . in these lists , i ' m including some at least seemingly semantically transparent compounds like neuschnee ( ` new + snow ' ) , schneeregen snow + rain ' ) and so on , as well as some words that are only frosty and not very snowy , as well as some that have only to do with snow and nothing else . in a serious collection , the data should be much richer , in order to have a borderline between good and bad examples fall well within the field , allow an assessment of the fuzzyness of this line , and , perhaps , discover some model for the cognitive structure of the words in question . ( the data for the english list is , apart from some editing , taken from tony woodbury 's posting ( see vol-5 - 1239 ) ) . granted not everything white in the listings given is snow , how can we comment on the quotation above ? at least , the writer should have told the reader why so many snowy words of english do not count as snow , or , perhaps , that eskimo in his opinion has no cover term , where english does have one . as it stands , however , it should make everybody very cautious about obtaining data of any language - - - including , obviously , their own - - - by way of secondary sources . likewise , how much do the manymany ` facts ' drawn from ` exotic ' ( i . e . , not very well documented ) languages count , which , for example , phonologists like to decorate their elaborate articles with ? two , i do n't really get the point in excluding words like cornice from a snowy list . now if there are people out there who use the word primarily to denote some sort of snow formation and feel the word is in its * architectural * meaning of rather metaphorical nature , what 's the point in telling them they ' re ` really ' wrong ? in german , waechte , flocke and harsch might very well be derived from some other morphemes . in fact , this only tells us eskimo is not very well documented . i guess a lot of those words the hoax claims as semantically primitive would turn out much more connected to the rest of the vocabulary had we only the relative wealth of historical data we have for the indoeuropean languages . back to german again , flocke to me primarily denotes not ` something flaky ' but rather precisely ` a snowflake ' , and all other usages seem to be derived from that . harsch seems to be connected with harsch ` harsh ' ; but used as a noun , what other denotation but that kind of slighly melted and frozen snow does it have ? loipe is the kind of tracks skiers use in their discipline and , i guess , not a ` very german ' word - - - but disregarding borrowed words is just as silly as looking down on adopted children . anyway , there seems to be a need for that word . it 's snowy , very specialized , and , for my feeling , totally unconnected with any other word in german . of course i might be totally wrong ( and loipe is derived from ( ski ) laufen ` to run ( to ski ) ' ) . now there 's the point . linguists are looking , on the one hand , into history to find out what really happened and try to extrapolate people 's minds to describe what 's really going on . if there 's someone with a lot of waechten and cornices and flakes on his mind , but with no connection to other non-snowy words for him , this is a fact of that ideolect . of course , as soon some linguist comes along and tells him the historical truth , behaviour and concepts of the speaker might change . . . even if in fact it was some sort of folk-etymology he absorbed when listening to the linguist : - ) . folk - etymology is there because it is a way we can imagine things to be . . . so , what layer of this person 's brain is it that synchronic word counting is claiming to acount for , and how historical a derivation is allowed or necessary in historical linguistics ? finally , i would like to point out that apart from some pretty specialized words having to do woth snow , rain is another phenomenon languages may have more or less to say about . in german , for example , you have niesel and nieselregen , denoting a very light rain or spray . there seem to be no other uses or compounds for this word apart from es nieselt , however , and no immediately related , more basic word niesel could be said to be derived from . so , we have wasser , regen , niesel , and more . eskimo does n't appear that much outlandish any more , does it ? quotation taken from : trudgill , peter : _ sociolinguistics : an introduction _ . penguin books . 1974 wolfgang lipp castor @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de i52023 @ sakura . kudpc . kyoto-u . ac . jp",

Is it possible to get some sort of \u003e low- \u003e end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. \u003e 40 \u003e Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra \u003e cost \u003e but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost. \u003e \u003e What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device, \u003e then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the \u003e last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible? \u003e I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as \u003e part \u003e of the charge for colocation is rackspace. \u003e \u003e Thanks, \u003e Ciaran.I'd recommend a good external DLT drive. You will probably need a SCSI card for that too.Mmmm.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

07 $ 2 . 20 image matching has emerged as an important area of investigation in medical image analysis . in particular , much attention has been focused on the atlas problem , in which a template representing the structural anatomy of the human brain is deformed to match anatomic brain images from a given individual . the problem is made difficult because there are important differences in both the gross and local morphology of the brain among normal individuals . we have formulated the image matching problem under a bayesian framework . the bayesian methodology facilitates a principled approach to the development of a matching model . of special interest is its capacity to deal with uncertainty in the estimates , a potentially important but generally ignored aspect of the solution . in the construction of a reference system for the human brain , the bayesian approach is well suited to the task of modeling variation in morphology . statistical information about morphological variability , accumulated over past samples , can be formally introduced into the problem formulation to guide the matching or normalization of future data sets . bayesian approach to the brain image matching problem j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor r . bajcsy ircs-95 -

10 $ 1 . 28 in a lexicalized grammar formalism such as lexicalized tree - adjoining grammar ( ltag ) , each lexical item is associated with at least one elementary structure ( supertag ) that localizes syntactic and semantic dependencies . thus a parser for a lexicalized grammar must search a large set of supertags to choose the right ones to combine for the parse of the sentence . we present techniques for disambiguating supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies . the similarity between ltag and dependency grammars is exploited in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation . the performance results for various models of supertag disambiguation such as unigram , trigram and dependency-based models are presented . a freely available syntactic lexicon for english dania egedi patrick martin ircs-95 -

13 $ 2 . 00 like many verb-final languages , german displays considerable word-order freedom : there is no syntactic constraint on the ordering of the nominal arguments of a verb , as long as the verb remains in final position . this effect is referred to as ` ` scrambling ' ' , and is interpreted in transformational frameworks as leftward movement of the arguments . furthermore , arguments from an embedded clause may move out of their clause ; this effect is referred to as ` ` long-distance scrambling ' ' . while scrambling has recently received considerable attention in the syntactic literature , the status of long-distance scrambling has only rarely been addressed . the reason for this is the problematic status of the data : not only is long-distance scrambling highly dependent on pragmatic context , it also is strongly subject to degradation due to processing constraints . as in the case of center-embedding , it is not immediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly complex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions , or whether we should assume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on scrambling ( and that , therefore , all such sentences are in fact grammatical ) , and the unacceptability of some ( or most ) of the grammatically possible word orders is due to processing limitations . in this paper , we will argue for the second view by presenting a processing model for german . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * how to access reports : the reports are available in bound form for the price listed above , or may be obtained for free , electronically . to obtain a compressed postscript copy of the report , open an anonymous ftp session on ftp . cis . upenn . edu path : pub / ircs / technical-reports the files are named according to their number . for example , report 95-01 is stored as 95-01 . ps . z , 95-02 is stored as 95-02 . ps . z , etc . if you are using ftp , change the setting to binary and download the file . to get a copy of report 95-01 , you would type : binary get 95-01 . ps . z you can also obtain files through electronic mail . send a mail message to ircsserv @ ftp . cis . upenn . edu . the message should read \" send technical-reports filename \" . you will receive the compressed postscript file in reply . requests for bound copies should be sent to the address listed below , and include a check for the price of the desired report . checks should be made payable to \" trustees of the university of pennsylvania . \" jodi kerper jbkerper @ central . cis . upenn . edu institute for research in cognitive science 3401 walnut street , suite 400c philadelphia , pa 19104-6228",

    "email": "\nTCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the MassesWhile security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces\nof the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they\nhave tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as\nfar as concerns such as privacy and security go, or\nalternatively, in terms of how they would impact the\nfunctionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts\nboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from\nthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to what\nthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what content\ncontrol itself really means.The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not\nwhether they may interfere with the power of the universal\nlogic device, or whether they are effectual from the\nstandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these\nare all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental\nproblem they present is in the political premises that they\nhope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\"TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the\nconcepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\nTreaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May\n20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The\nWPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to\ncontrol public uses of their works.*That's* the real game plan.TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the\nmasses.  They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content\ncontrol under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the\npublic to overlook the clear public interest issues raised\nby the specter of content control, and to confuse these\nissues with private interest issues such as privacy and\nsecurity.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on\nthe bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's\nreally on the line.In America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral\nrights\" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution\naccords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive\nrights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting\nthe progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the\npurpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though\nthat result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights\nstatutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court\nexplicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good\nreason.  In America, we implicitly understand the\ndistinction between expression, the aspect of works to which\ncopyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make\nup a work, to which it does *not* apply.The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must\nbe stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:\ninformation is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it\n*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,\nhowever, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes\nto \"universal content control\" for the sake of so-called\n\"moral rights\" implemented at the behest of narrow content\nindustry interests.TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage\nthe general public, and more specifically producers of\ninformation products in general, to identify content control\nwith \"moral rights,\" blithely overlooking the real\nimplications of information technology in a free society,\nand the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding\nthe freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the\nprospects of information technology crucially depend.Seth Johnson-- [CC] Counter-copyright:\nhttp://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cc/cc.htmlI reserve no rights restricting copying, modification or\ndistribution of this incidentally recorded communication. \nOriginal authorship should be attributed reasonably, but\nonly so far as such an expectation might hold for usual\npractice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no\nclaim of exclusive rights.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

How would you like \nto generate more income through a different avenue? What \nif it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another \nprogram, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. \nThere \nis NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW\nTHOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH \nYOU \nIS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest\nto you! Please read all of this. This is not something \nthat I would normally look at, except that I read an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about \nPayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it \nwould work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had\nalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. \nYou can complete this whole process in one hour and you \nwill never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! \nDid I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the \nInternet-type fast.' Everything is done on the\nInternet by E-mail.NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from\nindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a \nlittle of their time.TESTIMONIALS FROM:Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:\nHey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of\nour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 \ngrand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run \nthis program again........Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:\nHey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to\nyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said \nand went on vacation. When I got back, my account was \nup to over $12,000! I owe you!GETTING STARTED.If you're not already a user, the very first thing you\nneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes \nand PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this \nprogram FREE!Here's the link:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.comBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO \n$100 \nDOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) \nto the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note\nlike \"Please add me to your mailing list.\" BE PREPARED TO GET\nEXCITED.... YOU \nWON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the \nothers \nto start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No \nprinting, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US \nPostal and \nLottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, \nSection 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal \nRegulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a \nproduct or service must be exchanged for money received). Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this \nTHREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much\nfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY \nHIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see \nresults in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT \nMONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 \nor more as in other programs). Ideally, you should\nsend them to people who send their programs to you or to \npersonal contacts who are already working on the web, \nbecause they know these programs work and they are already \nbelievers in the system! Besides, this program is \nMUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already \nin \nanother program, stay with it, but do\nyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long \nbefore others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE \nperson a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET \nWHEN \nYOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have \na \nPayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 \nGIFT \nto\nthe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list \nat No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow \nthe simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 \nin your bank account!Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT \nPOTENTIAL, \nthis program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 \ntransaction that you get from PayPal!!!Follow These Simple Instructions: E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST \nname on the list (No.1) along with a note saying \n\"subscribe me to your mailing list\". Only the first \nperson on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the \nother \ntwo names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first \nplace \nin order to earn money fast! \nIf you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-\nmail to then your name will be immediately removed\nfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if \nyou add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of \npeople receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in \nthe body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. \nSend out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the \nresponse \ntime is much faster...

    "email": "book review gopnik , alison and andrew n . meltzoff ( 1997 ) words , thoughts and theories . cambridge : mit press . 268 pages . $ 14 ( paperback ) reviewd by laura wagner , university of massachusetts . gopnik and meltzoff ( g\u0026m ) have written a book that is full of ideas and information . they are interested in what our representations of the world look like and they are pushing the view they call the theory theory : that our representations are organized around theories . more than that , they argue that children 's representations of the world are also organized around theories and that developmental changes children undergo are in fact changes in their theories . even more than that , they argue that the theory revisions that children make are of precisely the same type as scientific theory revisions . that is , the difference between a 9 month old and an 18 month old is essentially the same as that between a newtonian physicist and an einsteinian physicist : they possess qualitatively different theories of how the world works . the use of \" words \" in the title refers to two claims that g\u0026m make : one , that children 's early vocabulary reflects technical notions in their theory du jour and two , that linguistic elements can act as part of the evidence children use in theory building . the book is divided into three sections , in addition to the introduction and conclusion . the first section addresses the theoretical commitments of the theory theory and relates it other theories of cognitive organization and development . the second section examines three domains of knowledge for evidence of children 's changing theories . the third section has a neo - whorfian flavor and addresses the question of how different languages could effect children 's theory-building . part 1 : the theory theory in this section , g\u0026m face head on what is certainly the most difficult of their claims to swallow , namely that children 's early theories about the world are qualitatively the same as scientific theories and subject to revision in the same ways . while acknowledging that there are many differences between the ways scientists and infants operate , they nevertheless maintain that they both construct the same sorts of theories in the same ways . the theories of both are abstract and general , and therefore provide a means for making predictions in a variety of domains . both groups are concerned with the match of the theory to the world and will maintain a theory only as long as the evidence supports it . when evidence mounts against a theory , the theory holder goes into a transitional state , actively seeking out new sorts of evidence , conducting experiments and developing new technical vocabulary as they settle into a new and better theory . one of g\u0026m 's strong claims is that the standard adult theory ( the so-called \" folk-physics \" and \" folk-psychology \" , e . g . ) is in principle open to revision ; it was developed in response to inadequate child theories of the world , and , as with all scientific theories , it too will be revised , if the need arises . the second chapter in this section compares the theory theory to two other prominent cognitive models , modularity and empirical generalizations ( e . g . , scripts , connectionism ) . g\u0026m do not present the theory theory as a substitute for either of these models completely but as taking over some roles from each . thus , with respect to modularity , the theory theory accounts well for many central cognitive processes and some of the less perceptually oriented modular processes ; with respect to empirical generalizations , the theory theory is better equipped to deal with things like causal linkages and can provide a deeper level of explanation in general , but such generalizations may still form an important basis for the creation of theories . part 2 : evidence for the theory theory part 2 consists of three chapters which each take on a different knowledge domain and show how the theory theory can explain children 's development in these areas . chapter 4 deals with children 's theories of appearances and addresses children 's development with respect to object permanence . chapter 5 takes on children 's theories of action and causality with animate and inanimate things . chapter 5 addresses children 's developing theories of natural kinds . each chapter discusses what the adult theory in each of these domains looks like and then marshals experimental evidence that demonstrates what the infant 's initial theory looks like and what subsequent revisions to their theory the children make . in each domain , they argue that children make crucial theory changes around the ages of 9 months and again around the age of 18 months . g\u0026m report the results from many experiments ( a large number of them conducted by g and / or m themselves ) which amply illustrate that children 's competence in these domains changes ( and improves ) with age . this experimental evidence is at times augmented with anecdotal accounts of how infants affectively interact with different tasks at different ages . g\u0026m are looking for scientific behavior from these children and it is therefore important not only that children can pass more tasks as they get older ( and their theories get better ) but that they view the tasks differently as they get older . they point to examples of emotional consternation that infants show around the time that their theories are putatively changing . thus , a 15 month old will fail to find an object that has been secretly moved to a new hiding place but will be unperturbed by her failure ; a 21 month old will find the object in the new place but will be unimpressed by her own success . an 18 month old , however , is both deeply disturbed when she fails ( and by the structure of the task as a whole ) but is joyful with success . g\u0026m argue that such affective differences reflect something like the blase-ness of normal science compared to the eureka moments that mark a theory in change . with respect to linguistics , one of the claims from these chapters is that early utterances may correspond to technical vocabulary of newly formed theories . g\u0026m 's arguments are particularly intriguing with respect to performative utterances , such as \" gone \" and \" uhoh \" which are quite frequent in the speech of 18 month olds but have been largely ignored in language acquisition studies . they claim that , for example , the emergence of the word \" gone \" in child speech is closely linked with children 's ability to solve an invisible displacement task ( when an object is secretly moved to a new hiding place ) . \" gone \" indicates an object that is out of sight for any reason , and it is in effect a technical term , reflecting a concept in the infant 's new theory . part 3 : language and thought in the previous chapters , the kinds of evidence that g\u0026m suggested were driving theory formation and revision arose primarily from children 's interactions with objects , actions and people in the world . in this chapter , g\u0026m note that language itself is part of the child 's world and different languages could in principle provide different kinds of evidence . since the children 's theories are not innately given but are presumed to be constructed on the basis of the evidence they get from the world , different kinds of linguistic evidence could lead to different theories , or at least to different rates of theory formation . they find support for the effects of language in theory building in a series of longitudinal , crosslinguistic studies looking at children acquiring korean and english . they do not cover the experiments in detail , but the gist of them appears to be that korean is more verb-centric while english is more noun-centric and this linguistic difference translates into korean children developing their theories of action more quickly than their english counterparts , who for their turn , develop their theories of natural kinds more quickly than the korean children . evaluation despite the fact that the theory theory informs an active psychological research program , this book is primarily a book of philosophy . thus , the results from a large number of experimental investigations are discussed but no one experiment is discussed in sufficient detail to be critically evaluated . any reader not already well acquainted with the cognitive developmental literature may find themselves somewhat confused ( and perhaps somewhat unconvinced ) about how g\u0026m are able to draw the conclusions that they do from the experiments reported . this problem might have been remedied to some extent by detailed explanations of one or two experiments that could act as representative examples and the use of diagrams depicting the sorts of tasks used to test infants . a few more diagrams and / or summary tables would have been helpful in general . the theory theory is dynamic in form and g\u0026m trace two or three theory changes within three different knowledge domains . the critical point about theory change comes through clearly , but many of the details get lost in the mass of information ; a summary table describing the different theories ( and perhaps the evidence that leads to theory revision ) would have been a useful reference . although g\u0026m devote an entire chapter to persuading the reader that infant theory development and scientific theory development are the same , ultimately this argument remains unconvincing and the insistence on this point throughout the book has the effect of lessening the force of their claims , rather than strengthening them . there are many reasons to be skeptical of the link between the two sets of theory builders but i think the most compelling reason to reject their argument is that it seems to do a grave injustice to the entrenchment of our folk-scientific reasoning . in a nutshell , our adult folk-science is a stable level of knowledge and may not , even in principle , be subject to revision . g\u0026m try to argue against this powerful intuition in two ways . first , they point to the fact that science has moved beyond our folk theories , so those theories can't be the last word in what is true . while i agree that einsteinian physics is probably more true ( i . e . , a better model of the world ) than my own folk-physics , i ' m still stuck with my inadequate theory . g\u0026m appeal to the division of knowledge-labor to claim that the theory really has changed at a societal level , but that only highlights the fact that for the common person , our folk-science is unrevisable . g\u0026m 's second argument that our folk-science is open to revision is that we can imagine a world that would require a different theory , and they frequently invoke the tv show star trek as illustrating such a world . this fantasy argument leaves me entirely cold , partially because i have no strong intuitions ( as g\u0026m seem to ) about , for example , the status of objects in a star trek transporter beam , and partially because i believe that they are placing far to heavy a burden on a piece of popular fiction . it should be noted , however , that rejecting the most extreme of g\u0026m 's claims does not fundamentally undermine their arguments that knowledge is organized around theories and that developmental change reflects changes in children 's theories . even if children 's theories are not of the same type as scientific theories , analyzing our knowledge in terms of some kind of theory and children 's development as some form of theory change is still a very intriguing and compelling perspective to take . in sum , g\u0026m have raised a number of extremely interesting questions about the nature of knowledge representation , the nature of theories , the nature of cognitive development and the relationship of language to cognitive development . they offer the theory theory as a way to address these questions and , although one might not believe that the theory theory actually has the answers , it is certainly an important view in the debate . reviewed by laura wagner , department of psychology , university of massachusetts - amherst . my research centers on children 's acquisition of tense and aspect .",

    "email": "16 - m clean e - mail addresses 16 million clean e - mail addresses we took a total of over 92 million e-mail addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super \" sort / de-dupe \" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! can you believe that ! ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many \" program generated \" e-mail addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . . . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash . etc . . . we then ran a program that contained 150 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . . . also we eliminated all . edu , . mil . , org . , gov . , etc . . . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 16 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and a lot less time ! we also purchased cyber promo 's ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 million that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's e-mail addresses from top to bottom . we did not clean these , but we did create 3 separate files named cyber1 . txt , cyber2 . txt , and cyber3 . txt of 100 , 000 addresses each . this will give all people that use the list an opportunity to send mail to the list before deciding if their cd is all it 's hyped up to be . we also included a 2 + million \" remove / flamer \" file broke into separate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . \" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . here 's what you get when you order today : * 16 million e - mail addresses * one line in simple text format * all on cd-rom * files are in lots of 100 , 000 ( no codes to open files ) * all files are separated by domain name for your convenience ! * plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! * plus a sampling of cyberpromo 's hot list now only $ 149 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . the result is the cleanest e - mail addresses available anywhere to use over and over again . all for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring e-mail lists are from \" information highway \" robbery !

    "email": "comparatives summary : intensification of the comparative i had in may on the list ( 8 . 758 ) a query on the intensification of comparative forms in different languages . here comes the summary related to the query ( i am sorry about the slight delay ! ) . as i noted earlier , my better linguistic competence limits to germanic languages plus finnish where in all the comparative ( of adjective , adverb , quantitative pronoun ) is typically intensified with an adverb denoting some form of totality : 1 . a . the train went faster . b . the train went ever faster . ( also : all the faster ) 2 . a . der zug fuhr schneller . b . der zug fuhr immer schneller . 3 . a . ta ' get gick fortare . b . ta ' get gick allt fortare . 4 . a . juna meni lujempaa . b . juna meni yha \" lujempaa . ( also : aina lujempaa ) the intensifiers , e . g . ever in english , are in all these cases some kind of universal quantifiers , the content being approximately ' always ' or ' all the way ' ( see e . g . vendler ) . since the pattern shows some regularity , i was curious to gather information about functionally corresponding expressions in other languages . indeed , i did receive some further parallel examples , and moreover , there was some discussion about the appropriateness of the english example i had in the query ( 1b above ) . many thanks to the people who responded : ewb2 @ cornell . edu ( e . wayles browne ) larry horn \u003c lhorn @ yalevm . ycc . yale . edu \u003e ton van der wouden \u003c vdwouden @ let . rug . nl \u003e allan wechsler \u003c awechsle @ bbn . com \u003e knud lambrecht \u003c lambrec @ uts . cc . utexas . edu \u003e adiego lajara \u003c adiego @ lingua . fil . ub . es \u003e asya pereltsvaig \u003c asya @ mail . netvision . net . il \u003e \" j . l . sancho , instituto de lexicografia \" \u003c sancho @ crea . rae . es \u003e waruno mahdi \u003c mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de \u003e bark @ compunet . net ( gerald a . barker md ) philip grew \u003c pgrew @ compuserve . com \u003e as always , my wordings were a bit too implicit in the beginning . there are , of course , several ways of intensifying ( or modifying ) the comparative . a very normal form would be intensification of the degree , e . g . 5 . he is much faster than the rest of the guys . two individuals possessing a quality may also be compared with each other and one of the qaulities intensified in relation to the other : 6 . jack is fast but bob is even faster . perhaps it was my swedish perspective that led to the too general and implicit use of the label ' comparative intensifier ' . it seems , namely , that swedish has in allt ( see 3 above ) an adverb that may be used as an intensifier only with the comparative ( other adverbs may also be used but this is a kind of a prototype , as one can understand on the basis of wessen 's grammar , for instance ) , whereas the general intensifier mycket ( ' much ' , ' very ' ) may be used both with the positive and the comparative ( type 5 then ) . the distribution is not perhaps as strict in all languages and with all expressions . as regards , for example , finnish yha \" , it may be used in other contexts too , but it seems that it has a more specialized ( grammaticized ? ) intensifying function when modifying a comparative , e . g . 7 . a . jaana on yha \" kaunis . time adv . ' jane is still beautiful ' b . jaanasta tulee yha \" kauniimpi . intensifer ' jane becomes ever more beautiful ' but this shows only that intensifiers that merely relate to the comparative do have a temporal implication . as a consequence , it seems that the comparative expresses a dynamic quality ( or degree ) that is opposed to the more stable positions of the positive and the superlative degrees ; the comparative represents a step in one direction but not to a definite point on a scale . the temporal intensifiers of the comparative focus on this implication of dynamism which , in turn , is often associated with successive development , change or process ( cf . the dynamism of verbs ) . moreover , the succession is signalled to be constant and ever-present - - and here we find the motivation of the universal quantifiers ( literally ever ) typically used with the comprative . we might want to look at some examples provided by the respondents ( the names of which are given in appropriate language sections below ) : * * * * * - - dutch : 8 . a . de trein ging sneller b . de trein ging alsmaar sneller c . de trein ging steeds sneller * steeds * and * alsmaar * ( also written as * almaar * ) are universal temporal quantifiers ( over a restricted domain - * altijd * is more unrestrictive ) . ton van der wouden - - - spanish : 9 . el tren iba cada vez ma 's ra ' pido \" cada vez \" , lit . \" each time \" catalan : 10 . el tren anava cada vegada / cada cop me 's ra ` pid \" cada vegada , cada cop \" , lit . \" each time \" nb : a ' , e ' etc . : vowels with acute accent ;

it seems to be an application of the temporal comparative as in , for instance : 18 . jack has become faster than before . koenig suggests instead the term \" cumulative comparative \" , since the development is related to the temporal and the reference is often clearly enough understood in the context ( the term could be better for the indonesian ' accelerative ' too ) : 19 . jack has become ever faster . could in principle be a thinkable notional parallel to 18 ( cf . also 17b above ) . now , 19 ( and 1b for that matter ) may be a bit odd for english speakers , having seen the reactions on ever in my original query . ever is as an intensifier considered to be \" stilted , literary , old-fashioned , high-style \" , regarded as inference from german immer , or by americans labeled as \" british \" . instead , most speakers prefer a semantically corresponding expression consisting of conjoined syntactic reduplication : 20 . jack has become / becomes faster and faster . dictionaries and grammars of english also note this construction with the comparative ( zandvoort gives it even a name , \" comparative of gradation \" ) , so the expressive pattern can be regarded as quite established in english . it is not unique , though . most european languages allow the pattern comp + and + comp at least in informal register , and , i may reveal it now , these kinds of expressions are the object of study in my research on syntactic reduplication in swedish . the principally interesting thing is that languages seem to have different preferences as regards different intensifying patterns . english is perhaps most liberal in rather freely allowing conjoined repetition of type 20 , whereas koenig points out that german prefers expressions with an intensifier ( immer ) . the data i have surveyed seem to suggest that swedish is somewhere in between these two . the pattern comp + and + comp is theoretically interesting in that it expresses the same content as ever by iconicity . repetition stands for iteration and continuity ( ever , allt , sempre , yha \" , cada vez ) , coordination enhances the meaning , since it implies with repetition non-simultaneity and asymmetry . even more intriguing is that some linguists ( e . g . koenig , lang ) draw a parallel between coordination and universal quantification . so we have a full circle here . as a final remark , i would like to remind that structures of the kind x + and + x are not limited to the comparative . it is quite usual to hear the use of this pattern with , for instance , verbs in colloquial speech : 21 . jack ran and ran . however , the use has not for some reason become as widely established with verbs . perhaps there is a larger resource of aspectual verbal and adverbial modifiers for verbs than the comparative , and , thus , less need for the somehow ' naive ' iterative pattern . the last assesment does not come out of the blue , but it is traditionally stated that different uses of repetitions are typical of , not only the language of poetry , but also among women and children or in texts designed for children , such as fairy tales ( note : this is merely a quote - - i would not put it in this way ! ) . what does this amount to ? reasonably , repetition is favored in discourse types where ( inter - ) personal involvement has an important role . further comments on the topic are , of course , welcome . the above summary is written in a relative haste , so i apologize for any shortcomings or misunderstandings ! the end of this message contains a list of works referred to . thank you for your interest and have a nice summer !

Simply backup your /home, /etc\n\u003e \u003e(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll\n\u003e \u003eprobably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)\n\u003e \n\u003e I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you\n\u003e do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file\n\u003e because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a\n\u003e rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way.If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument \nagainst using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that \nthey \na) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some \nsort of autodetection and changing crap)\nb) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because \nformats have changed.Red Hat is not \"taking it easy\" on this, it's putting control in the hands \nof you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.\u003e Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my\n\u003e laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is\n\u003e dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data?\n\u003e Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box\n\u003e with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a\n\u003e space computer with a large HD with much free space).You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put \n/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use \nthe same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the \ndata as is.If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need \nto make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup \nand rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over \nssh.  It's the best way to make backups.\u003e These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they \ncame from ;)Good luck,\nThomas\n-- The Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n\u003c-*-                      -*-\u003e\nYou know the shape my breath will take before I let it out\n\u003c-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*-\u003e\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list \nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n",

( however , this would still require finding an internal enron \" sponsor \" to assume ownership of the relationship ) . 6 . much of hanover ' s growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally . given enron ' s domestic opportunities , this international orientation in a non - core business is inconsistent with our present strategy . 7 . like gkh , enron has been a seller of our hanover position . an abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the street about enron ' s strategic direction . additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the limitations of the gkh analysis with respect to increasing enron ' s eps : 1 . if pooling of interest accounting is available , any acquisition enron makes of any company that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accretive to enron ' s eps . there is nothing \" remarkable \" about this , it is simple mathematics . 2 . if purchase accounting is required , even if the entire purchase price were accounted as \" goodwill \" and never amortized , this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest . however , in actuality , a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets ( tangible and intangible such as contracts ) which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the gkh analysis . 3 . the largest single \" synergy \" by far in the gkh analysis is usage of enron ' s nol to shield hanover ' s taxable earnings . enron can obtain the benefit of its nol by acquiring any profitable company . gm recorded about $ 3 . 4 billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this enron asset . 4 . the gkh analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction , i . e . the potential negative impact on enron ' s own pe . dick",

Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. \n    \"This is Frank Bellknap Long!\" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a \n    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on \n    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English \n    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, \n    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his \n    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. \n    \"No reason! No corners!\" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with \n    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. \"Our next song is about \n    Harlan Ellison!\" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, \n    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy.     Blï¿½ï¿½dhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing \n    themselves as \"edu-core,\" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash \n    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the \n    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands \n    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: \"The Faster You Go \n    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.\"  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Zed[3]!_)[1] http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020930/bloodhag.shtml\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/kfFeZdnp8NE\n[3] http://www.mememachinego.com/\n",

Come to think of it, the last story I posted about \nCanada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military \nHQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.'\nOwen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*\nBy Declan McCullagh \nStaff Writer, CNET News.com\nAugust 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT\nhttp://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html \n*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that \nwould force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy \nsurveillance by police and spy agencies.*A discussion draft  \nreleased Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every \nCanadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the \nright to be anonymous online.The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice \n and Industry Canada \n, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step \nin a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to \nconduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe's cybercrime treaty \n, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n, \nor ratified, the treaty.Michael Geist , a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that's not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case.\"Geist added that \"there's nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \n \nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \nthe draft says.Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous \nmobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet \nanonymously,\" Hosein said.A representative for George Radwanski \n, Canada's privacy commissioner, said \nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \nthe paper as it stands.\"Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \n no later than Nov. 15.\n",

I am\ncontacting you in view of the fact that we will \nbe of\ngreat assistance to each other likewise \ndeveloping a\ncordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of \nthirty\nsix million United States Dollars \n(US$36,000,000) in\ncash, which I intend to use for investment \npurposes\nspecifically in your country. This money came \nas a\nresult of a payback contract deal between my \nlate\nhusband and a Russian firm on our country's\nMulti-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The\nRussian partners returned my husbands share of\nUS$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with \nmy\nlate husband's security company in Nigeria of \nwhich I\nam a director. Right now the new civilian \ngovernment\nhave intensified their probe on my husband's \nfinancial\nresources and they have revoked our licenses \nthat\nallows us to own a financial and oil company. \nIn view\nof this, I acted very fast to withdraw the\nUS$36,000,000 from the company's vault and \ndeposited\nit in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money \nneither is\nthe money traceable by the Government because \nthere is\nno documentation showing that we received the \nmoney\nfrom the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country \nconcerning\nGovernment attitude towards my family, it has \nbecome\nquite impossible for me to make use of this \nmoney\nwithin, thus I seek assistance to transfer this \nmoney\ninto your safe bank account.

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my\nfather's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail\nexchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news\ncame hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:\n\"Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of\na heart attack at home.\" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's\ngroup meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like\na beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal\nwith, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone\nactually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she\nhad seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't\ninteracted much over the past few years, she was still able to see\nme on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to\nJon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a\nfew months ago:\n\"I evangelized for months last year for having our company at\nthe first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines\nlast October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite\nbeing postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last\nminute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again\nbeing 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this\nyear. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email\npublishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a\nfriend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their\nCall for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you\nget the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I\nhave my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.\nIt's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.\"\nI returned from speaking to another user group the other night and\nfound that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.\nSweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized\nthat Jake was offering his Converting\nVinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was\ntaking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them\nwere just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a\nproblem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out\nthe non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please\nlook again). A lot of blood,\nsweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In\nfact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which\nprobably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple\nmachine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use\nDreamweaver.\nWhich reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly\nnewsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage\nyou to give it another glance. After all, as Elwood\nEdwards so finely said: You've\nGot Lockergnome! Thanks to David\nLawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your\nname, too. And yes, that's the AOL guy.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â \nÂ GnomeDOWNLOADS\nVLINK v0.6.8.0 [257k] W9x FREEhttp://www.vxtech.org/{Desktop link manager} Nothing gets you there faster than a link.\nI mean, imagine if while you're surfing, you had to stop and type\nin a URL every time you wanted to move to a new page.

And every time, it has resulted in\nincreased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the\nadvances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including\nDolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed\nby the music industry as different from previous such\ndevelopments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to\ncreate their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual\nresult was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music\nindustry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became\nmore popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD\ntechnology).The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -\n and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of\nsongs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be\ninstituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the\nserver-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations\nplaying their music in the 30s, when they really thought the\nphenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused\non the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,\nand most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've\nlimited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -\n and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to\navoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright\nis not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think\nof as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,\nyou lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with\nthe window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove\naway in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be\nentitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are\naware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you\nare voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for\nthe same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a\ncopyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products\nwhenever they're mentioned, and not use words like \"Coke\" or\n\"Kleenex\" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to\ndo what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of\none's product become the generic term for a product is actually a\ngreat marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some\npoint could start using the word on their own product, arguing\nthat it is in the public domain.The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually\nstopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they\nknow from long experience, increases their sales because most of\nthe people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with\nnear-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the\ncost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the\ncost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is\ncommitted by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the\nfirst place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at\nestablishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,\nin the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a\nlegal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.\nThe thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is\nthe change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music\ncommerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a\nfew good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for\nif they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to\nmake as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it\nrequires charging far more for an individual song that most people\nare willing to pay.At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of\ncivil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to\nthe Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly\ndirected to realities and necessities, in light of history and\ncase law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most\ntechnically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a\nsimple moral or criminal issue. \"Common sense\" tells a lot of\npeople that copying music without paying for it is just like\nstealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if\ncommon sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have\nthe law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual\nsystems, including not only law but science, are designed in large\npart to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the\ncase in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those\nsystems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that\nmost people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any\ntime a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an\nissue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a\nmatter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what\nhe means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you\nbelieve that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't\nbe paying him as much as he is.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking?

day workshop on interactions in virtual reality ( vr ) environments . anyone dealing with theoretical , empirical , computational , experimental , sociological and anthropological aspects of vr environments that are either purely artificial or use real world characteristics is invited to participate in this workshop . in this workshop the emphasis is on vr environments that provide means for interacting with the objects in the environment , with embedded information sources and services ( possibly represented as agents ) or with other users and visitors of the environment . motivation in recent years we have seen that the computer science and the cognitive ergonomics communities have discovered and are exploring the possibilities of vr in user interfaces . in order to visualize available information and to provide users access to this information , virtual environments have been built such that users can find and explore information , communicate with other users and can communicate with objects and agents in the virtual worlds . this workshop emphasizes the role of vr in interfaces and in environments in which people share knowledge and experience and in which new forms of interactivity will emerge . in particular we want to explore the role of speech and language in virtual environments . how can we navigate in vr using speech and language , how can we model multimodal access to such environments , how can we communicate with other humans and with artificial agents in the vr environment , etc . the workshop is organized in the context of the u - wish project of the dutch telematics institute . format the format of the workshop will consist of keynote presentations by experts in the fields of vr , dialogue modelling and speech and language processing , combined with presentations of accepted papers . all presentations will be plenary . submission procedure researchers working in this domain are invited to email a 400 -

the ' psychology \" part i disagree with because of its unspecified universal implications , perhaps better : \" overwhelm semantics \" . most people , except gender separatists , would be particularly untriggered to a masculine reference to words such as \" sportsmanship \" and \" penmanship \" . i liked the construction of one of the first lady 's publicist who said of her , \" she is her own best salesman \" . \" man \" and \" he / his / him \" have differing semantic domains over time . in middle english \" he was a fair wife \" , \" two men were made for the garden \" , etc . if in the modern mind these constructions trigger male associations , it might make all the more necessary the study of historical change . in my middle english work with pronouns , some contexts can be found where \" he that . . . \" in proverbial use , with sometimes-plural verbs , has the weight of proverbial \" they who \" , and is related morpholgically to the feminine , not the masculine . a radical idea i wish someone would challenge me on . also , \" him \" and \" his \" were not only masculine , they were also neuter - - \" neither one or the other \" . to understand the modern paradigm , we have to study the history it grew out of , including the protogermanic and ie paradigms . i wonder if h . stephen straight has read my comments and quotations on \" the mark \" in recent discussion . all of us , men and women alike , can be described in some capacities as \" generic people \" . is n't this what we mean by \" society \" ? one veiw of the half-glass sees that we , as generic people , desire to give females preferential treatment , and have distinct words for those of us who are female ( she , women ) , but parallel words for males are , lacking , are tautonyms . we , those of us who are male , are relegated to use a word also used for everybody else . \" masculine \" is only sex-distinct in contrastive position with the \" feminine \" . the reason for generic pronouns doubling with the masculine is because men are , in our \" psychology \" thought of more frequently as generic people . females have long been accorded special priviledges in western society - - we do n't execute murderesses , we create conditions for those of us who are women to live 10 % longer than men , we exclude them from the military draft , old women commit suicide at a rate less than 1 / 12th that of old men , etc . that is not to say that everybody does n't have it rough once in a while . men do not externalize their victimization to a metaphorical \" daddy \" . i personally think that women should go on being afforded special status and privileges in language and society . the turning wine to venom these passed decades has shown the dark side of our society . the writer says \u003c \u003c \u003c \" every one of the members of the boys and girls club loves his parents . \" \" the cultures of the world provide ample testimony on the extent of man 's capacity to adapt to different environments . \" no matter that the situations logically embrace both sexes ( and all genders : - ) , the damage is done . \u003e \u003e \u003e it is the \" logic \" of an intuitive sort , and is not based in boolean and identity operations of the human mind . the \" logic \" is no more than a rule-base in the configuration of gender / case / number of the modern pronoun paradigm . use of the word \" logic \" by many of us who discuss language is off the mark . i use \" everyone . . . their \" , and wonder about the linguistic timidity that holds others of us back . damage ? does this mean exclusion from semantic space : - ) the writer continues , \u003c \u003c \u003c yucatec maya , by the way , has no grammatical gender and , to the best of my knowledge , exhibits no morphological or semantic tendency toward treating either sex as the unmarked member of the pair . h stephen straight , anthro / ling / lgs across the curric , binghamton u ( suny ) box 6000 , binghamton ny 13902-6000 tel : 607-777 - 2824 fax : 607-777 - 2889 \u003e \u003e \u003e this seems counter to the idea that says universal male cultural dominance is seen in male dominance in language constructions - - that alexis manaster ramer postules in slightly more qualified form . it sure would be nice to have other examples , pro and con , from around the world . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - lydie meunier writes \u003c \u003c \u003c question raised in answer to alexis manaster ramer who writes : \u003e so what it all boils down to , again , is that i maintain that \u003e it makes no sense whatever to discuss the origin of the \u003e epicene he phenomenon in the context of the story of \u003e english prescriptive grammar , but only in the context of \u003e the way in which perceptions of sex roles have informed \u003e the structure of language ( as of any other institution ) . have perceptions of sex roles informed us on the structure of language , or does the structure of language enlighten us on socially acquired yet still subconscious sexist behavior of today 's homo sapiens ?

The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, \"That isn't me.

Promiscuous is more than I do.\" If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.\"You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.

Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P.Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\nVast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedSeptember 30, 2002\nBy JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON \n What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and\ncomplete understanding of exactly how and why the twin\ntowers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as\npart of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in\nLower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated\ninsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the\nconfidential material contains data and expert analysis\ndeveloped by some of the nation's most respected\nengineering minds. It includes computer calculations that\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\nthe collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\nfailures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \"We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\nwe can't until we're told what to do,\" said Matthys Levy,\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of \"Why\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail\" (Norton, 2nd\nedition, 2002). \"Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\nprocess\" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\n\"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\nwould be devastated,\" Mrs. Gabrielle said. \"They have a\nmoral obligation.\" The lawsuit that has generated the information involves\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\nof the findings, \"There are some confidentiality agreements\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today.\" He\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\nrelease of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone have\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\nwould be made to give the material eventually to \"public\nauthorities and investigative teams.\" Still, some of that analysis relies on information like\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\ncompany's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\nwould be \"decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\napplicable law and policy,\" adding that it would cooperate\nwith \"federal investigations.\" The fate of the research is particularly critical to\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\nthe buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\nstudied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\nthe lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\nthe real estate executive's own heavily financed\ninvestigative work, \"We decline to comment other than to\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\ninvestigation.\" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\nsaid no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \"The work should be available to other investigators,\" said\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\ninquiry. \"It could be used to build better buildings in the\nfuture.\" Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\nhave them sealed forever. \n\"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\nsome legitimate, some not,\" said Lee Levine, a First\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan \u0026 Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \"It's important for this to get presented and published and\nsubjected to some scrutiny,\" said Dr. John Osteraas,\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\ncase, \"because then the general engineering community can\nsort it out.\" The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\npinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\nthe towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine \"where things\nactually fell,\" Mr. Cuoco said, \"we've indicated the\nspecific locations.\" Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\ninvestigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computers\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\nthe weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\nhad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the\noriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For\nthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, \"we've done probably more\ndetailed measurements than in the original design.\" \"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in\nthemselves for understanding how wind and buildings\ninteract,\" Dr. Cermak said. \"Some of the information may be\nvaluable for the litigation,\" he said, adding, \"I think\nI've told you all I can.\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663\u0026ei=1\u0026en=0d3143a997e5e2e1HOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfoFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.

What I didn't \nunderstand was that SuSE had proprietary \nextensions that it wasn't prepared to allow\npeople to use under the GPL or even under  a\nFreeBSD style licence.\nI thought that the model for the likes of \nSuSE was selling support and customisation, \nrather than what I thought of as the core\n\"product\". I thought that the likes of Yast\ncame under core - maybe it worked in the glory\ndays before, say, 2001 - I can understand that\nthey might want to make more money, but the way\nin which they have done it, seems to me, to be \nbe against the spirit of the GPL. \n\u003e You're further confused if you think the GNU \n\u003e GPL gives you the right to get covered software\n\u003e for free.  It does not.  All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under\nthe impression that for *_those_* all one\nneeded was to pay for the media and not for the\ncode itself?Ai-je tort?\n\u003e It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received\n\u003e a copy of the covered binary version, you have\n\u003e rights to also receive the matching source code.My understanding was that binaries or whatever\ncould be received for the cost of the media plus\na token of one's appreciation (the latter being\nsubject to agreement between the parties) - I was\noffering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two\nand a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going\nrate is.\nIf I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a\ndifferent issue, and one for which I would be\nwilling to pay.\n \u003e \u003e I don't particularly need support, so I'm \n\u003e \u003e no really interested in purchasing a set of \n\u003e \u003e disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.\n\u003e Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's\n\u003e contents, the only way you can do that without\n\u003e copyright violation _and_ without having to pay\n\u003e the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ \n\u003e (not \"lend\" or duplicate) you his copy.\nI have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll\nend up doing that!Seems to me to go against the spirit of\nthe GPL though.\n\u003e \u003e Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a \n\u003e \u003e friend with 7.3 pro, so I'll just ask him.\n\u003e Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to \"lend\" or\n\u003e duplicate his CDs, then you'll be ripping off SuSE\n\u003e Linux AG illegally.\nI have now realised this, thanks to your kind\nexplanations. I can borrow them, but not \ncopy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against\nthe spirit of the GPL though. \n\u003e Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your \n\u003e own distribution.  \nAnd why not my own OS, while I'm at it?\n\u003e You can even grab most of what you need \n\u003e _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is heed the\n\u003e licensing terms on the individual pieces.\nAnd, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence\nterms on, say, trials for commercial company x\nto which I object, it is the way SuSE appears, \nat least to my I.T. peasant self, to have\nmixed up proprietary and open stuff. \n\u003e What, you think that's too much work?  Then, \n\u003e try a different distribution.\nHence my \"To hell with SuSE\" post...\n\u003e Clue: _Not_ one packaged in a retail\n\u003e boxed set.  Even RH 7.3 retail boxed sets include\n\u003e non-freely redistributable applications on\n\u003e the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity\n\u003e Applications CD, among others.\nAnd I have no problem with people sticking trial\neditions along with GPL'ed stuff. Why you \ncan't pass those on though, is beyond me.\nPaul...___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en franÃ§ais !\nYahoo!
